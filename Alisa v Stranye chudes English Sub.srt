Based on the fairy tale by Lewis Carroll

ALICE IN WONDERLAND

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,720
Part 1

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:24,840
The author of this fairy tale is Lewis Carroll,
an able mathematician, logician and linguist.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,760
He wrote it in the middle of the 19th century

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,080
while taking walks in the vicinity of Oxford,
along the bank of the River Thames.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:44,360
He wrote it at the request
of the little girls who were his good friends.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,480
Lewis Carroll had written a strange tale.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,800
Everything in it is like in a fairy tale,
and yet it doesn't look at all like a fairy tale.

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,400
So, Alice got tired of sitting on the bank,
and of having nothing to do.

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,240
She peeped into the book,
but it had no pictures or conversations in it.

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,920
Her thoughts were slow and disconnected,
for the hot day made her sleepy.

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,840
I shall be late! Oh, dear! I shall be too late!

16
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,880
The Duchess will be furious!
She will be just savage!

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,080
Only now Alice realized that she had
never before seen a rabbit with a watch

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,960
and a waistcoat pocket to take it out of.

19
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,160
Burning with curiosity, she ran after it.

20
00:01:49,720 --> 00:02:01,200
After such a fall as this,
I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs!

21
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,520
How brave they'll all think me at home!

22
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,360
Why, I wouldn't say anything about it
even if I fell off the roof.

23
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,560
Either the well was very deep,
or Alice fell very slowly,

24
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,240
for she had plenty of time to look about her,
and to wonder what was going to happen next.

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,040
Excuse me, sir, can you tell me
how many miles I've fallen by this time?

26
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,440
I must be getting somewhere
near the center of the earth.

27
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,480
That would be four thousand miles down, I think.

28
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,400
I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth!

29
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,080
How funny it'll be to see the people
that walk with their heads downward!

30
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,760
What's their name? The Antipathies, I think...

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,240
No. No, the Antipodes!

32
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,280
Down and down Alice went.

33
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,640
“Dinah'll miss me very much
tonight,” she thought.

34
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,560
Dinah was her cat.

35
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,400
Oh, Dinah, I wish you were down here with me!

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,200
There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid,
but you might catch a gnat.

37
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,840
But do cats eat gnats, I wonder?

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,040
Oh, no, do gnats eat cats?

39
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,440
Oh, my whiskers! Oh, my poor ears!

40
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,360
The Duchess will never forgive me for being late.
She will be savage!

41
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,960
When Alice thought it over afterward,

42
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,600
it occurred to her that she
ought to have wondered at this.

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,200
But at the time it all seemed quite natural.

44
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,320
And Alice went after
the White Rabbit like the wind.

45
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,200
But the White Rabbit was no longer to be seen.

46
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,200
Alice found herself in a long hall.

47
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,920
Alice decided that the key
might belong to the door.

48
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
But, alas!

49
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,240
Either the lock was too large,
or the key was too small,

50
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,640
but it would not open that door.

51
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,440
To Alice's great delight,
the key fitted this door!

52
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,040
Oh, how she longed to get out of here!

53
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,240
But she could not even get
her head through the hole.

54
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,360
And even if my head would go through, it would
be of very little use without my shoulders.

55
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,400
Drink me.

56
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,160
Alice knew that some unpleasant things
had happened to children,

57
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,840
all because they would not
remember three rules.

58
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,720
They were very simple rules.

59
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,440
That a red-hot poker will burn you
if you hold it too long.

60
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,240
That if you cut your finger very deeply
with a knife it usually bleeds.

61
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,560
That if you drink much
from a bottle marked “poison”,

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,720
it is almost certain to disagree
with you sooner or later.

63
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,640
Alice had never forgotten that last rule.

64
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,880
However, since this bottle was not marked
“poison” , Alice ventured to taste it.

65
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
What a curious feeling!

66
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,720
I must be shutting up like a telescope.

67
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,040
Eat me.

68
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,120
Alice saw that her feet were getting so far off.

69
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,400
Another moment, and they will be out of sight.

70
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,200
Goodbye, feet! Oh, my poor little feet!

71
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,360
I wonder who will put on
your shoes and stockings for you now?

72
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,720
I'm sure I shan't be able!

73
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,200
All right, I'll send them
a new pair of shoes every Christmas.

74
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,200
Oh, dear! What nonsense I'm talking!

75
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,120
If you please, sir...

76
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,720
Dear, dear! How queer everything is today!

77
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,960
If I am not myself,
then who in the world am I?

78
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,400
Ah, that's the great puzzle...

79
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,640
Let's try to remember Geography.

80
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,640
London is the capital of Paris.

81
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,800
And Paris is the capital of Ro... Rome.

82
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,440
No, that's all wrong.

83
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,440
I'll better try and say a poem.

84
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,760
This is the house that Bug built.

85
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,200
This is the singer
That's kept in the pantry

86
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,320
In the house that Bug built.

87
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,480
This is the cheerful Empress

88
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,760
That bites at the singer

89
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,960
That's kept in the pantry

90
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,320
In the house that Bug built.

91
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,960
No, those are not the right words.

92
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,520
Who am I, then?

93
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,520
Oh, that's because of that magic fan!

94
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,800
Imagine that because of some thing,

95
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,800
you can grow so small
and just shrink away altogether!

96
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,960
No, no! I must get out of here.

97
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,920
I wish I could grow a little larger.

98
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,240
And then I'll find my way to that lovely garden.

99
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,760
It was really a good idea.

100
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,160
Alice knew that in order to grow larger
one had to eat or drink something.

101
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,120
But there was nothing around
that would suit that purpose.

135
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,400
Part 2

136
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,200
Alice was getting so used
to queer things happening

137
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,560
that she was not at all surprised
at this encounter.

138
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,400
The Caterpillar was quietly smoking
a long hookah,

139
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,600
taking not the smallest notice of anything else.

140
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,040
You...
Who are you?

141
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,440
I hardly know, ma'am, just at present.

142
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,120
I know who I was when I got up this morning,
but I changed so often since.

143
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,360
What do you mean? Explain yourself.

144
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,760
I'm afraid I can't,
because I'm not myself, you see.

145
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,960
I don't see.

146
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,440
I can't understand it myself.

147
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,440
Being so many different sizes in a day!

148
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,360
You see, everything's moving somewhere
and turns into something.

149
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,360
What are you not content with?

150
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,360
I keep getting small when I need to be large.

151
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,440
And the other way round.
It's very uncomfortable.

152
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,520
One side will make you grow taller.

153
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,560
The other side will make you grow shorter.

154
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,440
One side of what?
The other side of what?

155
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,320
Of the mushroom.

156
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,840
Alice was looking at the mushroom, and tried
to make out which were the two sides of it.

157
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,160
As it was perfectly round,
she found this a very difficult question.

158
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,240
And now which is which?

159
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:55,160
Now there will be less of that stupid uncertainty!

160
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,000
Dear Cheshire Puss, would you tell me, please,
which way I ought to go from here?

161
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,400
And where do you want to get to?

162
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,120
I don't much care where
so long as I get somewhere.

163
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
Then it doesn't matter which way you go.

164
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:31,120
You're sure to get somewhere
if you only walk long enough and not turn.

165
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,760
What sort of people live about here?

166
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,520
In that direction lives a Hatter.

167
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,040
And in that direction lives a March Hare.

168
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,240
Visit either you like: they're both mad.

169
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
Why?

170
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,240
The Hatter worked so much with hat blocks,

171
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,440
that he got absolutely block-headed,
so now his nickname is Blockhatter.

172
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,080
And the March Hare
has gotten absolutely cross-eyed.

173
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,320
I mean, from the March sun.

174
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,880
But I don't want to go among mad people.

175
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,600
Oh, you can't help that. We're all mad here.

176
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
I'm mad. You're mad.

177
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,600
Would you please not vanish so suddenly, sir?

178
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,960
All right.

179
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,480
Well... I've often seen a cat without a grin,
but a grin without a cat!

180
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,800
It's the most curious thing I ever saw.

181
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,240
She had not gone much farther before
she saw the house of the March Hare.

182
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,400
At the table, the March Hare
and the Blockhatter were having tea.

183
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,320
A Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep.

184
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,200
- No room! No room!
- There's plenty of room!

185
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,240
Have some wine.

186
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,320
I don't see any wine.

187
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,800
Of course you don't! There isn't any.

188
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,160
Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it.

189
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,880
It wasn't very civil of you to sit down
without being invited.

190
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,200
This table is laid
for a great many more than three.

191
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,720
Would it be better
if there were more of us and fewer cups?

192
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,480
You should say what you mean.

193
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,680
I do. At least I mean what I say.
That's the same thing.

194
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,240
Not the same thing a bit!

195
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,560
You might just as well say that “I see what I eat”
is the same thing as “I eat what I see”.

196
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,800
I think you are just wasting time.

197
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,360
If you knew Time as well as I do,
you wouldn't talk about wasting it.

198
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,600
Of course, of course. I quite agree with you.

199
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I dare say you never even spoke to him!

200
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,120
Perhaps not, but I know
I have to beat time when I learn music.

201
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,720
He won't stand beating!

202
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,680
Yes. We quarreled with Time.

203
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,200
It's always six o'clock now.

204
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,560
And it's always tea-time.

205
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,880
We even have no time
to wash the cups between whiles.

206
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,960
It's the stupidest tea-party
l ever was at in all my life.

207
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,560
I'd better go quickly to the garden.

208
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,000
Open it!

209
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,960
Would you tell me why
you're painting those roses?

210
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,840
You see, Miss, this here ought
to have been a white rose-tree,

211
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,960
and we put a red one by mistake.

212
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,200
If the Queen was to find out,
we shall all have our heads cut off.

213
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,000
“What a cardtege!” thought Alice.

214
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,720
The word seemed to sound wrong,
but she didn't know how to correct it.

215
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,600
Perhaps she, too, ought to lie down
on her face before this grand procession?

216
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,360
But Alice could not remember any such rule.

217
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:04,160
What would be the use of a procession if people
had to lie face down, so they could not see it?

218
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,480
What is this?

219
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,280
- Your Majesty, they wanted...
- I see. Off with their heads!

220
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,320
Don't be afraid. You shan't be beheaded.

221
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,120
Are their heads off?

222
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,000
Their heads are gone, Your Majesty!

223
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,080
That's right.

224
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,760
- Can you play croquet?
- Yes!

225
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,480
Get to your places!

226
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,640
Off with her head!

227
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,160
Off with his head!

228
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,680
Off with that head, too!

229
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,920
They're dreadfully fond
of beheading people here.

230
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,320
The great wonder is,
that there's anyone left alive!

231
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,120
How are you getting on?

232
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,040
Who are you talking to?

233
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,760
It's a friend of mine, a Cheshire Cat.
Allow me to introduce it.

234
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:35,280
I don't like the look of it.
However, it may kiss my hand if it likes.

235
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,200
Thank you, I'd rather not.

236
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,000
Executioner, come here!

237
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,480
Off with his head!

238
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:04,680
I can't cut off a head
unless there is a body to cut it off from.

239
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,280
Anything that has a head can be beheaded!

240
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,320
I'll think about what I shall do with you.

241
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,520
And he will be tried
by the Royal Court of Justice!

Part 3

277
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,760
Before the court building
where Alice ran to, a crowd was gathering.

278
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,720
Make way for the Duchess!
Make way for the Duchess!

279
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:01,800
You dear thing, you can't think
how glad I am to make your acquaintance.

280
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,720
She is not mean at all.

281
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,040
Why is the Rabbit so afraid of her?

282
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,960
She must be so nice because of the doughnut.

283
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,560
Doughnuts make people sweet-tempered.
I seem to have found a new kind of rule!

284
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,960
Vinegar makes people sour.

285
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,680
Camomile makes them bitter.

286
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,680
Pepper makes them hot-tempered.

287
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,680
I only wish people knew that!

288
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,840
Then they wouldn't be so
stingy about doughnuts.

289
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,440
You're lost in thoughts, my dear,
and that makes you forget to talk.

290
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:48,160
I can't tell you just now what the moral
of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.

291
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,480
Perhaps it hasn't one.

292
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,880
Everything's got a moral,
if only you can find it.

293
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,280
Flamingoes and mustard both bite.

294
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,680
And the moral of that is:
birds of a feather flock together.

295
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,600
Mustard is a mineral, I think.

296
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,960
Right, as usual.
What a clear way of putting things!

297
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,560
Of course, it is a mineral!

298
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,320
There's a large mustard-mine near here.

299
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,080
And the moral of that is:

300
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,480
The more there is of mine,
the less there is of yours.

301
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,840
Oh, I know! Mustard is a vegetable.

302
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,240
How fond she is of finding morals in things!

303
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,680
I quite agree with you.

304
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,680
And the moral of that is:

305
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,840
Be what you would seem to be.

306
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,480
Or if you'd like it put more simply -

307
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,720
Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise
than what it might appear to others

308
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,280
that what you were or might
have been was not otherwise

309
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,920
than what you had been would have
appeared to them to be otherwise.

310
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,640
Silence in the court!

311
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,400
Silence in the court!

312
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Alice had never been in a court of justice
before, but she read about it.

313
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:18,040
She was quite pleased to find that she
knew the name of nearly everything here.

314
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,280
“Those must be the jurors,” thought Alice.

315
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,360
“And that's the judge, because of his great wig.”

316
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,640
The Duchess saw the Queen
and began to tremble.

317
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,200
And in a moment, she was gone.

318
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,600
Herald, read the accusation!

319
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,680
The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,

320
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,480
All on a summer day.

321
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,960
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,

322
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,080
And took them quite away!

323
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,280
Consider your verdict.

324
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,360
Not yet, not yet!
There's a great deal to come before that.

325
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,200
The Rabbit got scared of his own audacity.

326
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,600
To say “no“ to the Queen herself!

327
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,080
First witness!

328
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,160
I beg pardon, your Majesty, I...
I'm a poor man.

329
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,600
Give your evidence, and don't be nervous,
or I'll have you executed on the spot.

330
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,360
- I hadn't finished my tea when...
- Get to the point.

331
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm a poor man.

332
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,280
I keep thinking of the bygone days.

333
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
Days.

334
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,120
Dumb like a dunce.

335
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,280
Perhaps, we shall make him dance?

336
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,960
Well, it's a play upon words.

337
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,600
Next witness, the March Hare!

338
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,440
Next witness, the March Hare!

339
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,520
I didn't say anything.

340
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,840
He denies it, doesn't he?

341
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,160
I didn't think anything.

342
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,360
Suppress him!

343
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,840
Alice had read in the newspapers:
“The attempts at resistance were suppressed.”

344
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,560
Now she understood what it meant.

345
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,840
At this moment,
Alice felt a very curious sensation.

346
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,440
She realized she was growing larger again.

347
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,880
Alice decided to remain where she was
as long as there was room for her.

348
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,880
Next witness, Alice!

349
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
Here!

350
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh, I beg your pardon!

351
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,120
What do you know about this business?

352
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,800
Nothing.

353
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,040
What? Nothing whatever?

354
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,480
Nothing whatever.

355
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,000
That's very important.

356
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,480
Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course.

357
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,560
Unimportant, of course, I meant.

358
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,360
Unimportant, of course, unimportant.

359
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,800
Important... Unimportant...
Unimportant... Important...

360
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,360
There's more evidence to come yet,
please your Majesty.

361
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,280
This paper has just been picked up.

362
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,000
What's in it?

363
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,640
I haven't read it yet, but it seems to be
a letter written by the prisoner to somebody.

364
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,600
Who is it directed to?

365
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,240
It isn't directed at all.
There's nothing written on the outside.

366
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,320
Is it in the prisoner's handwriting?

367
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,920
No, and that's the queerest thing about it.

368
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,000
The Knave must have imitated
somebody else's hand.

369
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,800
Please your Majesty,

370
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,080
I didn't write it.

371
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,000
There's no name signed at the end.

372
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,720
That's even worse.

373
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,800
You must have meant some mischief,
or else you'd have signed your name

374
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,200
like an honest man.

375
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,960
That proves his guilt.

376
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,080
It proves nothing of the sort!
Why, you don't even know what it's about.

377
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,080
Read it.

378
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,640
Of course, she has the fits of rave
Whenever she gets bolder.

379
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,600
But, see, it's not altogether safe
To cut straight from the shoulder.

380
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,200
To cut from the shoulder?

381
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,520
Have I ever cut straight from the shoulder?

382
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,920
Never!

383
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,840
I cut off heads from the shoulders,
never from one shoulder!

384
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,760
It's a pun!

385
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,560
Let the jury consider their verdict.

386
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,400
No, no! Sentence first.

387
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,120
Verdict afterwards.

388
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,240
Stuff and nonsense!

389
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,440
- Hold your tongue!
- I won't!

390
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,400
Off with her head!

391
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,400
Who cares for you?

392
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,280
You're nothing but a pack of cards!

393
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:14,680
“What a curious dream I've had,” thought Alice,
and she ran home, not to be late for tea.

394
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,840
In the future, she would be a grown woman

395
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,120
and, keeping the simple and loving
heart of her childhood,

396
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,520
would tell other children about Wonderland

397
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,160
and remember her own childhood

398
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,240
