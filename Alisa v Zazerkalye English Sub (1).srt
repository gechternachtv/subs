1
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:11,067
Through the Looking Glass

2
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,939
after the eponymous tale by L. Carroll

3
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:20,107
Part One

4
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:28,610
It was a quiet winter evening

5
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:38,866
Fluffy, soft snow was falling and it
seemed that there, behind the window,
was as cosy and good as here, in the room.

6
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:49,891
Alice was sitting in the big armchair,
and little Kitty was having real fun
hunting a wool ball across the floor.

7
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:59,065
Oh, Kitty, how wicked you are!

8
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,458
Listen up, Kitty, can you play chess?

9
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:24,002
Let's pretend we're kings and queens!
You'll be Black Queen and I'll be all the
other kings and queens at the same time.

10
00:01:24,843 --> 00:01:31,994
Oh, Kitty, if only you'd sit still
for a moment! I will tell you about
the house in the looking glass.

11
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:41,843
First, this room which begins right
behind the glass is exactly the same
as our living-room.

12
00:01:42,355 --> 00:01:44,882
Only there everything is the other way...

13
00:01:45,402 --> 00:01:51,242
I wonder if they'd give you milk in there?
However, I don't know whether one can drink
looking-glass milk.

14
00:01:51,874 --> 00:01:54,838
Perhaps it will harm you, Kitty?

15
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:11,074
Oh, Kitty, how nice it would be to
get through into the Looking-glass!
Let's pretend there's a way of getting through.

16
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:27,170
Then Alice found herself on the mantelpiece,
although she didn't notice how she had got there.

17
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:45,803
The room here was not at all so ordinary
as it seemed from other side of the looking glass.

18
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:15,579
Oh, what is it?

19
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:20,642
They probably don't see me.

20
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,210
It seems I've suddenly become invisible.

21
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:33,843
That's my baby!

22
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:46,978
Oh, Lily my kitten! Lily, my royal baby!

23
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:52,201
- Mind the volcano!
- What volcano?

24
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:57,474
The one that blew me up here.
Mind you come up the regular way.

25
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,266
You'll be crawling all day like this...
Let me help you, all right?

26
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:11,523
The King said nothing in reply. He,
clearly, could neither see nor hear Alice.

27
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:22,906
- My dear, I was so scared that I turned
cold to the very ends of my... whiskers!
- You haven't got any whiskers!

28
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:29,146
- The horror of that moment,
I shall never, never forget!
- You will, if you don't write it down.

29
00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:39,402
There Alice had a sudden thought: she
took hold of the end of the pencil
and began to write herself.

30
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:48,755
The White Knight is sliding down the poker...

31
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:53,338
But you wanted to write something
entirely different.

32
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:28,921
Why, of course, - this is a Looking-glass
book! And if I hold it up to a glass,
I will be able to read it.

33
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:46,506
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

34
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:52,034
Phew, it seems very pretty,
but it's <i>rather</i> hard to understand!

35
00:05:53,099 --> 00:06:02,826
And, as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,

36
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:11,794
And burbled as it came!
One, two! One, two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!

37
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:16,107
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

38
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:27,074
Why am I sitting? I must make haste
or I won't get to see all that is here.

39
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:36,481
Saying this, Alice ran down the stairs.
Or, at least, it wasn't exactly running,
but - how to explain it? - 

40
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:41,810
She floated gently down without even
touching the stairs with her feet.

41
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:46,410
Moving in this manner was unusual
yet wonderfully enjoyable.

42
00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:05,667
If I climb that hill, I will see the
whole garden at once. And here's a path
that leads straight up...

43
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:09,690
I suppose â€” no, it doesn't!

44
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:18,954
Wherever Alice went, wherever she turned,
every time she found herself at the house.

45
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:30,138
This house again! How fed up I am with it - 
it keeps getting under my feet!

46
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:36,418
So, resolutely turning her back upon the
house, she set out once more down the path,
determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill.

47
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,907
And the hill was quite near - near
enough to touch with her hand.

48
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:56,130
How do I get to this hill?
Oh, Lily, I <i>wish</i> you all could talk!

49
00:07:57,195 --> 00:08:00,250
We <i>can</i> talk, when there's anybody
worth talking to.

50
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:05,226
And can <i>all</i> the flowers here talk?

51
00:08:06,997 --> 00:08:09,997
As well as <i>you</i> can.
And a great deal louder.

52
00:08:10,397 --> 00:08:13,849
It's just that we think it
awkward for us to speak first.

53
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:27,441
- Are there other people in the garden besides me?
- There is one flower that has
the same awkward shape as you,

54
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:32,842
and that can move about like you.
- She's coming! I hear her footsteps!

55
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:46,378
Alice looked around and saw the Black Queen.
Of course, she found the flowers interesting
enough, but could they compare with a real queen?

56
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:57,323
I hear you saying: "like fairy-tale living"
But judge for yourselves: is that easily lived?

57
00:08:57,689 --> 00:09:08,122
You can't do a thing here without being cautious,
Because of uncertainly and of obscurity,
And lack of knowledge and unpleasantness...

58
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:14,579
Oh, it's so complicated!
And that's where the fun is!
You can't take one step here without taking care.

59
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:24,827
Well, who hasn't dreamed? I, also, have dreamed
That I'd enter a story, at least while I slept.

60
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:36,489
And enter I have, and the story's beginning
Seems very confusing, so very confusing
It all seems to me.
