WEBVTT

00:01:10.407 --> 00:01:16.004
EYES WITHOUT A FACE

00:06:02.087 --> 00:06:05.841
The Professor? No, not yet

00:06:11.527 --> 00:06:13.916
I'll tell him as soon as he finishes

00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:20.520
Man's greatest new hope
is the recapture of physical youth

00:06:20.567 --> 00:06:22.444
This hope...

00:06:22.487 --> 00:06:25.160
...is afforded by the heterograft

00:06:25.207 --> 00:06:28.916
But the heterograft, that is to say
the transplanting...

00:06:28.967 --> 00:06:33.757
...of living tissues or organs
from one human being to another...

00:06:33.807 --> 00:06:37.880
...has hitherto been possible
only when the two subjects in question...

00:06:37.927 --> 00:06:42.364
...demonstrate a perfect
biological compatibility

00:06:43.767 --> 00:06:51.685
What we must now do is modify
the organism receiving foreign tissues

00:06:51.727 --> 00:06:57.324
One method is to use heavy
radiation bombardment to destroy...

00:06:57.367 --> 00:07:04.079
...the antibodies which form
an obstacle to the heterograft

00:07:04.127 --> 00:07:08.917
To achieve this end, however,
the intense radiation required...

00:07:10.527 --> 00:07:13.724
...is such that the patient
cannot survive

00:07:14.527 --> 00:07:17.519
So exsangunination is practised

00:07:18.207 --> 00:07:23.998
The patient under radiation
is drained of the last drop of blood

00:07:31.207 --> 00:07:34.597
There was a call for you, Professor

00:07:34.647 --> 00:07:40.279
The forensic people... you know,
the morgue. You're to go right away

00:07:41.247 --> 00:07:44.523
Your paper was a perfect tonic

00:07:44.567 --> 00:07:48.685
Thrilling, wasn't it, Carlo?
What a wonderful future you showed us

00:07:48.727 --> 00:07:53.118
As to the future, Madame,
we cannot wait that long

00:08:01.207 --> 00:08:06.281
He's changed since his daughter
vanished, he makes strange remarks

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:18.163
It's a strange business,
but that's how it looks to me

00:08:18.207 --> 00:08:24.646
Génessier's daughter vanished
from the clinic, her face an open wound

00:08:24.687 --> 00:08:28.919
The lack of facial tissue of course
confirms your supposition

00:08:30.127 --> 00:08:36.236
The car crash, the facial burns,
then prolonged immersion in water...

00:08:36.287 --> 00:08:39.165
And the rats... don't forget the rats

00:08:39.207 --> 00:08:46.477
True. Yet the description
of this drowned girl fits Simone Tessot

00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:53.239
I asked the Tessot girl's father
to come in... something doesn't sit right

00:08:53.287 --> 00:08:57.439
It's odd that the body should have
been naked but for a man's coat

00:08:58.767 --> 00:09:04.637
Why should Génessier's daughter,
disfigured in a car accident...

00:09:04.687 --> 00:09:10.637
...feel the need to strip naked
before drowning herself in her despair?

00:09:13.767 --> 00:09:19.160
And that vast open wound
in place of a face is odd, too

00:09:19.207 --> 00:09:23.359
The edges are so clean
that it might have been done by a scalpel

00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:30.403
Here he is

00:09:56.327 --> 00:10:00.878
Doctor Lherminier... Inspector Parot,
from the Missing Persons Bureau

00:10:10.047 --> 00:10:14.677
I deeply regret the unfortunate
circumstances occasioning this meeting

00:10:14.727 --> 00:10:16.285
Please explain

00:10:16.327 --> 00:10:20.002
This morning, two bargemen retrieved
the body of a girl from the Seine

00:10:20.047 --> 00:10:26.122
The period of immersion tallies
with your daughter's disappearance

00:10:27.047 --> 00:10:29.481
The description also tallies -

00:10:29.527 --> 00:10:33.202
facial tissue destroyed,
the eyes undamaged

00:10:44.567 --> 00:10:46.717
IDENNTIFICATIONN ROOM

00:11:10.727 --> 00:11:12.558
It is her

00:11:25.047 --> 00:11:27.038
Monsieur Tessot is here, Doctor

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:31.922
Tell him we have an identification.
It is not his daughter

00:11:34.807 --> 00:11:37.082
I called him in case...

00:11:37.127 --> 00:11:40.119
Yes... of course

00:11:49.207 --> 00:11:53.246
Forgive me, Professor...
I'm Henri Tessot

00:11:53.287 --> 00:11:58.281
I came about my daughter,
but they tell me she was yours

00:11:58.327 --> 00:12:02.081
Are you certain, Professor?
Quite certain?

00:12:02.127 --> 00:12:05.358
All too certain, unfortunately

00:12:05.407 --> 00:12:11.277
It was such a shock when they called me...
I thought I would go mad

00:12:11.327 --> 00:12:17.436
It's ten days since we saw Simone.
Something must have happened to her

00:12:19.167 --> 00:12:25.640
Strange that I should have to comfort you,
for whom some hope yet remains

00:13:36.127 --> 00:13:39.199
I've simply got to find a room

00:14:00.327 --> 00:14:03.717
He gets more and more like his father
as he grows older

00:14:03.767 --> 00:14:07.396
Remember old Génessier, the notary?
He wasn't exactly skinny, either

00:14:07.447 --> 00:14:10.405
He doesn't enjoy munch luck, anyway

00:14:10.447 --> 00:14:14.884
Lost his wife four years ago,
now his daughter

00:14:14.927 --> 00:14:19.603
Paris, fame, fortune...
what does it all add up to?

00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:35.044
Who's the young man?

00:14:35.087 --> 00:14:40.719
The daughter's fiancé, a doctor.
He works with the Professor

00:14:40.767 --> 00:14:46.285
- And the woman?
- His "secretary". A foreigner

00:14:46.327 --> 00:14:48.636
She looks upset

00:14:57.207 --> 00:14:59.402
Go home, my boy

00:15:13.407 --> 00:15:16.956
- No, let's leave
- I like things done properly

00:15:37.167 --> 00:15:40.239
Let's go. I can't take any more

00:15:45.047 --> 00:15:46.446
Be quiet!

00:15:56.087 --> 00:15:59.477
For my beloved daughter

00:17:09.887 --> 00:17:12.196
Doctor Géressier's residence

00:17:12.247 --> 00:17:15.557
No admittance to patients
and their visitors

00:20:35.047 --> 00:20:40.041
Where did you find this? I don't like
the way you poke into everything

00:20:42.487 --> 00:20:46.116
I haven't the time to explain to you
just now

00:20:46.167 --> 00:20:49.045
You see here your name
bordered in black

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:54.682
What are you imagining it means?

00:20:54.727 --> 00:21:00.677
I don't have to imagine -
I see, I live horrors

00:21:00.727 --> 00:21:02.718
What have you done now?

00:21:02.767 --> 00:21:06.646
What had to be done, for your sake

00:21:07.567 --> 00:21:10.479
All of it is for your sake

00:21:12.247 --> 00:21:17.480
The announcement of a death,
the name substituted...

00:21:23.327 --> 00:21:27.115
That girl died after the operation,
you see

00:21:28.727 --> 00:21:34.484
I took another risk,
and pretended that it was you who died

00:21:36.487 --> 00:21:40.958
Since people think you are dead,
they will not ask questions...

00:21:42.727 --> 00:21:46.436
...or try to find out
what is going on here

00:21:46.487 --> 00:21:53.723
Christiane... your mask!
You must get into the habit of wearing it

00:21:55.167 --> 00:21:57.158
Where have you hidden it?

00:21:57.207 --> 00:21:59.482
The habit...

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:06.126
No, no, I only meant the habit
of wearing it until we are successful

00:22:07.727 --> 00:22:10.639
Please don't cry, darling

00:22:12.687 --> 00:22:14.882
I shall succeed, I promise you

00:22:16.887 --> 00:22:19.162
I don't believe that any more

00:22:32.687 --> 00:22:34.962
You have no reason to doubt me

00:22:36.727 --> 00:22:39.400
I'm a man of distinction, am I not?

00:22:41.247 --> 00:22:45.399
You shall have a real face,
I pledge you my word

00:22:53.127 --> 00:22:57.837
I'm not allowed mirrors,
but I can see my reflection in the window

00:22:57.887 --> 00:23:03.007
If the windows are open,
there are other shiny surfaces...

00:23:03.047 --> 00:23:07.120
...the blade of a knife, polished wood

00:23:07.167 --> 00:23:12.525
My face frightens me,
my mask terrifies me even more

00:23:12.567 --> 00:23:14.956
Have faith, Christiane

00:23:16.407 --> 00:23:20.195
Look at me... wasn't he successful
with me?

00:23:20.247 --> 00:23:26.686
You had a face, though. Ravaged perhaps,
but not destroyed like mine

00:23:26.727 --> 00:23:30.117
He's lying to me, because he knows
it was his fault

00:23:30.167 --> 00:23:35.195
His fault? It was a car accident,
pure chance

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:41.641
He always has to dominate,
even on the road. He drove like a demon

00:23:45.807 --> 00:23:49.959
I nearly died after the accident.
Why didn't he let me?

00:23:50.727 --> 00:23:55.562
I wish I were blind... or dead

00:27:24.087 --> 00:27:27.079
Who is this?
Why don't you say something?

00:28:10.247 --> 00:28:17.835
Would you like this spare ticket?
My friend hasn't turned up

00:28:17.887 --> 00:28:22.677
I'd be delighted,
but I thought of buying a cheaper seat

00:28:22.727 --> 00:28:25.719
There's no need to pay for it

00:28:58.887 --> 00:29:02.038
Sorry to be late. My class overran

00:29:03.727 --> 00:29:10.075
I was so anxious to pass on
the good news. I've found you a room

00:29:10.127 --> 00:29:15.599
I can't believe it. I'm so pleased...
how can I ever thank you?

00:29:16.607 --> 00:29:20.566
Thank me after you've seen the room,
I think you'll like it

00:29:20.607 --> 00:29:24.282
- Whereabouts is it?
- A very nice area

00:29:26.967 --> 00:29:29.435
Same again for the young lady

00:29:30.607 --> 00:29:36.955
I'll drive you there. The owners are friends.
Trees everywhere, you'll see

00:30:24.087 --> 00:30:25.884
It seems a long way

00:30:26.807 --> 00:30:32.564
I made a big detour.
The traffic is so heavy at this hour

00:30:45.887 --> 00:30:51.280
There's the train that will get you to Paris
in less than 20 minutes

00:30:53.087 --> 00:30:57.126
Don't you feel lonely,
so far away from your family?

00:30:57.167 --> 00:31:00.045
A little, sometimes

00:32:15.287 --> 00:32:19.439
Those dogs... how many are there?

00:32:19.487 --> 00:32:22.877
You see? You'll be well guarded

00:32:44.687 --> 00:32:46.882
Mademoiselle Edna Grünberg...

00:32:46.927 --> 00:32:48.758
Monsieur Dormeunil

00:32:48.807 --> 00:32:54.404
Delighted. A drop of port to pick you up
after your journey?

00:32:54.447 --> 00:32:57.757
No, thanks. I don't want to stay long

00:32:57.807 --> 00:33:01.402
We're not in that munch of a hurry

00:33:07.727 --> 00:33:10.366
In a moment, I'll show you your room

00:33:10.407 --> 00:33:14.605
It has a lovely view over the trees,
I'm sure you'll like it

00:33:14.647 --> 00:33:17.798
I don't know...
I'll have to think it over

00:33:21.087 --> 00:33:23.965
You really must see the room

00:33:28.407 --> 00:33:31.877
Of course, you can't judge properly
in the dark

00:33:31.927 --> 00:33:37.604
It's not that... but being so far out
isn't very convenient for me

00:33:37.647 --> 00:33:43.199
Not convenient?
It's very convenient here, very convenient

00:33:43.247 --> 00:33:49.243
Perhaps, but... I don't want to be too late
getting back tonight

00:33:51.287 --> 00:33:55.360
I must meet a friend.
I'll let you know tomorrow

00:33:56.007 --> 00:33:59.522
Tomorrow will be too late, my dear

00:36:34.607 --> 00:36:36.598
I'll start after diner

00:36:36.647 --> 00:36:41.516
This time I must try a larger graft...

00:36:43.567 --> 00:36:48.243
...removed in a single section

00:46:49.887 --> 00:46:54.642
People are all the same.
They love animals when they're young

00:46:54.687 --> 00:46:59.715
Then the animals grow up, eat too munch
and get dumped in the woods

00:46:59.767 --> 00:47:04.318
I don't think one should ever
do things by halves

00:47:06.767 --> 00:47:11.318
Especially as the second half
is by far the easiest

00:48:22.247 --> 00:48:28.038
- Did she eat well?
- Yes, luckily. She was wasting away

00:48:28.087 --> 00:48:31.238
She's happy this time. She believes

00:48:32.967 --> 00:48:35.435
I showed her how well it is healing

00:48:35.487 --> 00:48:41.039
It looks perfect,
so munch better than yesterday

00:48:41.087 --> 00:48:42.884
I was so afraid

00:48:42.927 --> 00:48:47.398
Don't be. I, too, believe this time

00:48:49.007 --> 00:48:50.998
I can only hope

00:48:54.847 --> 00:48:59.318
To achieve such a thing...
God, it would be beyond price

00:49:01.767 --> 00:49:04.918
I have done so munch wrong
to perform this miracle

00:49:06.167 --> 00:49:08.158
I have done you great wrong, too

00:49:08.207 --> 00:49:12.917
I know, but I shall never forget
that I owe my face to you

00:49:13.607 --> 00:49:17.759
Yes, I sometimes forget that myself

00:49:17.807 --> 00:49:21.243
With good reason,
it shows so little now

00:49:29.447 --> 00:49:32.439
What have you decided about Edna?

00:49:32.487 --> 00:49:38.084
Look after her, feed her.
I'll let you know later

00:51:28.407 --> 00:51:31.922
Edna has escaped... that way

00:55:34.327 --> 00:55:38.639
- No other details come to mind?
- No

00:55:40.687 --> 00:55:46.478
Yes... Edna said the woman always
wore a big pearl necklace

00:55:47.127 --> 00:55:52.076
Wound around her neck like a choker,
if you know what I mean

00:55:56.247 --> 00:56:00.604
Yes, but it doesn't help too munch

00:56:08.087 --> 00:56:10.681
You may go now, Mademoiselle

00:56:26.527 --> 00:56:30.998
Pretty, isn't she?
Another one with blue eyes

00:56:32.247 --> 00:56:37.640
All of them students, all the same age,
all the same type

00:56:37.687 --> 00:56:40.042
All mysteriously disappearing

00:56:40.087 --> 00:56:44.000
This one's Swiss, so we'll have
the embassy on to us, telephone calls

00:56:45.527 --> 00:56:51.716
Talking about the series of blue-eyed girls,
what about my one?

00:56:51.767 --> 00:56:54.884
Brought in for shoplifting

00:56:54.927 --> 00:57:01.605
Let her go with a lecture.
But get her address... you never know

00:57:07.927 --> 00:57:10.760
This sort of thing will land you in jail

00:57:10.807 --> 00:57:15.323
I've never done it before.
I don't know what got into me

00:57:15.927 --> 00:57:20.205
You'll be up in court next time.
Give me your address

00:57:20.247 --> 00:57:23.444
12 Rune des Pyrénées, 20th

00:57:24.887 --> 00:57:26.684
Now hop it

00:57:37.727 --> 00:57:40.116
I was certain of success

00:57:43.167 --> 00:57:45.556
To think you doubted me

00:57:47.647 --> 00:57:50.081
Now you have your pretty face

00:57:51.327 --> 00:57:53.557
Your true face

00:57:54.727 --> 00:57:57.525
You can start living again

00:57:58.847 --> 00:58:06.117
Yes... but how can we let people know
I'm still alive?

00:58:06.927 --> 00:58:10.636
To start with, you'll travel...
a long trip

00:58:11.927 --> 00:58:17.240
I'll arrange papers for you.
You can choose a name for yourself

00:58:18.687 --> 00:58:20.086
It'll be fun

00:58:20.727 --> 00:58:24.640
A new face, a new identity

00:58:26.607 --> 00:58:32.523
You're more beautiful than ever.
Now there's something angelic about you

00:58:34.767 --> 00:58:37.406
Angelic? That I wouldn't know

00:58:38.967 --> 00:58:43.040
When I look into a mirror,
I feel I'm seeing someone...

00:58:43.087 --> 00:58:48.684
...who looks like me,
returning from far away

00:58:51.567 --> 00:58:52.966
What about Jacques?

00:58:56.087 --> 00:59:01.878
Jacques? Yes,
that does pose a problem, of course

00:59:03.247 --> 00:59:08.719
I'll explain to him.
He loves you so munch

00:59:11.487 --> 00:59:13.842
He'll be very happy

00:59:15.287 --> 00:59:16.879
Smile...

00:59:17.687 --> 00:59:21.236
Smile... not too munch

00:59:40.647 --> 00:59:43.957
Try Pentothal. I'll come at once

00:59:47.527 --> 00:59:49.324
Another emergency

00:59:51.607 --> 00:59:53.199
Will you come with me?

01:00:15.807 --> 01:00:17.798
Not using make-up, I hope

01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:22.318
No. Why?

01:00:24.607 --> 01:00:29.601
No reason. You look good, that's all

01:00:31.967 --> 01:00:33.958
See you tomorrow, darling

01:00:40.287 --> 01:00:43.836
I won't be long.
I'll come and say good night

01:00:54.447 --> 01:00:59.999
- You seemed anxious, examining her
- You're imagining things

01:01:01.647 --> 01:01:03.444
Why are you lying?

01:01:03.487 --> 01:01:09.198
I've learned to read your face.
Tell me the truth

01:01:12.687 --> 01:01:14.279
It's failed

01:01:28.367 --> 01:01:30.164
February 15

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:38.443
February 20 A week after healing
spots of pigmentation appear

01:01:40.327 --> 01:01:45.845
Later palpation reveals
small subcutaneous nodules

01:01:48.447 --> 01:01:53.237
On the 12th day
necrosis of the graft tissue is evident

01:01:54.887 --> 01:01:57.276
20tl day

01:01:57.327 --> 01:02:03.402
The first ulcerations -
signs of rejection of the graft of infection

01:02:04.327 --> 01:02:07.637
The dead graft tissue
must be removed

01:02:41.087 --> 01:02:45.877
Take any dog, and everything works

01:02:49.567 --> 01:02:52.286
I'm stuck with this beastliness

01:03:48.887 --> 01:03:52.277
Say something... this is aggravating

01:04:08.447 --> 01:04:13.316
- Are you mad? Who were you calling?
- Nobody

01:04:13.367 --> 01:04:16.006
Do you realize how rash you've been?

01:04:16.647 --> 01:04:22.165
I know the dead should be silent,
then let me really die

01:04:22.207 --> 01:04:24.482
I can't bear it any more...

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:30.079
...afraid to look at one's face,
to touch it...

01:04:30.927 --> 01:04:36.684
...for fear of feeling the cracks
and furrows

01:04:39.567 --> 01:04:45.836
Calm down, my dear. Trust him.
He will succeed, I know it

01:04:45.887 --> 01:04:51.359
You're lying. He'll experiment
as if I were one of his dogs

01:04:51.407 --> 01:04:54.046
A human guinea-pig,
what a godsend for him

01:04:54.727 --> 01:04:57.082
You've no right to say that

01:04:57.127 --> 01:05:00.563
I want to die... please!

01:05:00.607 --> 01:05:05.556
Give me one of those injections
the dogs get when things go wrong

01:05:07.767 --> 01:05:09.041
Stop that!

01:05:09.087 --> 01:05:13.524
You must kill me.
I can't bear it any more

01:05:21.287 --> 01:05:23.278
Come at once!

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:27.324
It was Christiane's voice, I'm sure

01:05:27.367 --> 01:05:33.203
You thought you heard it... Have you
mentioned this to Professor Génessier?

01:05:33.247 --> 01:05:36.842
Of course, but he insists
the body was his daughter

01:05:36.887 --> 01:05:40.960
I know, I was there.
What can I tell you?

01:05:41.007 --> 01:05:43.840
A joke in bad taste, perhaps

01:05:46.207 --> 01:05:51.759
I deal in facts,
and these statements by witnesses...

01:05:51.807 --> 01:05:57.564
...are nothing but "seems", "possibly",
and vague details

01:05:58.567 --> 01:06:00.637
A red taxi picking a girl up...

01:06:00.687 --> 01:06:04.282
A pretty woman with a pearl choker
like a dog-collar...

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:07.239
...going off with another one

01:06:07.287 --> 01:06:09.801
A pearl choker like a dog-collar?

01:06:12.287 --> 01:06:14.596
That rings a bell with you?

01:06:17.967 --> 01:06:20.527
Yes, it reminds me of someone

01:06:52.447 --> 01:06:55.883
I thought that was all over

01:06:55.927 --> 01:07:02.241
I hoped so, Mademoiselle Paulette
Mérodon, but the high-ups think...

01:07:02.287 --> 01:07:03.879
...I was too lenient

01:07:06.527 --> 01:07:11.760
So I suppose I'm for it.
Must I go to jail?

01:07:12.567 --> 01:07:14.205
A court case first

01:07:17.607 --> 01:07:21.520
If I know my parents,
they'll never get over it

01:07:22.887 --> 01:07:28.757
I've been thinking... there may be a way
to get round all this

01:07:30.527 --> 01:07:35.396
Of course, it would involve
munch discretion, and some intelligence

01:07:35.447 --> 01:07:39.406
I can be very discreet.
As to intelligence...

01:07:39.447 --> 01:07:42.086
...if it's not too complicated...

01:07:42.127 --> 01:07:46.120
Don't worry, it's just a little service
you can perform for us

01:07:46.167 --> 01:07:49.842
- What must I do?
- Bleach your hair, for a start

01:07:49.887 --> 01:07:54.642
- You're joking
- Jokes aren't in our line

01:07:54.687 --> 01:07:58.965
- You have to be much blonder
- It won't suit me

01:07:59.007 --> 01:08:04.035
Never mind. Next you'll see a doctor,
who'll send you to a clinic

01:08:04.087 --> 01:08:07.841
- But I'm not ill
- You'll say you are

01:08:07.887 --> 01:08:10.765
Brief her on the details

01:08:10.807 --> 01:08:16.359
At the clinic, you'll complain
of headaches... I'll write this down

01:08:16.407 --> 01:08:22.198
I'll give you a note
to take to Doctor Gleize

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:25.879
He'll give you one for Doctor Génessier

01:08:33.447 --> 01:08:37.326
What? Wait, I'll note that

01:08:44.847 --> 01:08:47.600
She could come in tomorrow morning

01:08:49.127 --> 01:08:54.918
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on her.
It's only to check out a possibility

01:08:57.607 --> 01:09:01.077
If anything happens, I'll alert you

01:09:17.607 --> 01:09:20.485
You're doing well

01:09:20.527 --> 01:09:22.518
Thank you, Doctor

01:09:29.767 --> 01:09:32.201
She was admitted this morning

01:09:32.247 --> 01:09:34.920
- Referred by?
- Doctor Gleize

01:09:43.007 --> 01:09:44.599
Severe pain?

01:09:46.407 --> 01:09:50.036
Yes... sometimes

01:09:52.927 --> 01:09:57.876
Do an opthalmoscopic
and an electroencephalogram today

01:09:57.927 --> 01:10:02.398
Doctor... are they going
to shave my head?

01:10:02.447 --> 01:10:07.521
No... I hope not, anyway.
It would be a shame

01:10:36.847 --> 01:10:40.442
Don't be afraid...
we're friends, aren't we?

01:10:46.847 --> 01:10:49.839
Tell me how many fingers
I'm holding up

01:11:03.127 --> 01:11:04.719
Three

01:11:08.367 --> 01:11:11.279
And this time... how many?

01:11:13.127 --> 01:11:14.606
Three

01:11:16.167 --> 01:11:18.681
No... two

01:11:48.207 --> 01:11:52.280
- What do you think, Doctor?
- I'm very hopeful

01:11:54.687 --> 01:11:58.885
Can you make him better?

01:11:58.927 --> 01:12:03.000
Certainly... just trust me

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:12.286
- What's your prognosis?
- What is yours?

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.278
We're in agreement

01:12:21.767 --> 01:12:23.758
Close your eyes

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:26.998
Open your eyes

01:12:39.367 --> 01:12:41.835
That's it, you can open your eyes

01:12:45.607 --> 01:12:49.282
You'll feel a slight electric shock.
It won't hurt

01:13:40.127 --> 01:13:42.925
Send me the trace
as soon as you've finished

01:13:53.207 --> 01:13:57.723
No signs of anything wrong
with this Paulette Mérodon

01:14:11.567 --> 01:14:14.684
Haemorrhage in Number 15, sir

01:14:14.727 --> 01:14:16.718
See to that, Jacques

01:14:56.407 --> 01:14:58.557
Here's the trace, sir

01:15:02.927 --> 01:15:09.719
Nothing evident. Discharge her tonight,
that will free a bed

01:15:10.887 --> 01:15:13.720
We may well have an emergency

01:15:35.807 --> 01:15:39.117
Am I supposed to give you this form?

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:43.638
- May I make a call?
- To Paris? What number?

01:15:56.007 --> 01:16:01.798
Mum? It's Paulette. Everything's fine,
I'm coming right home

01:16:03.207 --> 01:16:05.675
- What do I owe you?
- No charge

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:08.195
How can I get back to Paris?

01:16:08.247 --> 01:16:12.206
There's a buns. Turn left as you leave,
a 15 minute walk

01:16:38.487 --> 01:16:42.480
Can I give you a lift
as I'm going your way?

01:16:57.287 --> 01:17:01.803
Inspector Parot? It's Jacques Vernon

01:17:03.727 --> 01:17:10.485
She's left already?
They don't hang about at your clinic

01:17:10.527 --> 01:17:13.360
They don't seem to be kidnappers,
either

01:17:15.687 --> 01:17:21.080
I'll check anyway,
to make sure she arrived home safely

01:17:21.127 --> 01:17:24.676
Thanks for calling us

01:17:40.567 --> 01:17:43.001
Two men want to see you at the clinic

01:17:43.047 --> 01:17:46.926
Not now. They can come back tomorrow

01:19:11.767 --> 01:19:16.397
Good evening, Professor.
We're sorry to bother you at this hour

01:19:16.447 --> 01:19:22.079
Did Mademoiselle Paulette Mérodon
in fact leave the clinic this evening?

01:19:23.007 --> 01:19:25.157
How did you know she was to leave?

01:19:25.207 --> 01:19:31.396
She called her mother
to say she'd be back. She never arrived

01:19:31.447 --> 01:19:35.156
So we've come to ask about her

01:19:36.127 --> 01:19:42.077
It's easily verified. My orders
were that this patient could go home

01:19:43.287 --> 01:19:47.599
- Has Paulette Mérodon left?
- I'll check

01:19:50.527 --> 01:19:54.440
So you're interested
in this young lady?

01:19:55.167 --> 01:20:01.720
Yes, she's involved in a case,
and we wanted to talk to her today

01:20:02.927 --> 01:20:06.317
I have a feeling
that you're a little late

01:20:06.367 --> 01:20:08.278
Paulette Mérodon...

01:20:09.367 --> 01:20:14.157
I remember now - a girl with blue eyes.
She made a telephone call

01:20:14.207 --> 01:20:17.358
I told her
where she could catch the buns

01:20:18.367 --> 01:20:24.886
I'm sorry, but once they go through
these doors...

01:20:24.927 --> 01:20:27.282
...patients are no longer
my responsibility

01:20:27.927 --> 01:20:33.445
I understand, Professor.
Forgive us for having bothered you

01:20:44.607 --> 01:20:47.679
Good night, then, Professor

01:20:48.447 --> 01:20:52.838
Since you're leaving, Jacques,
please show these gentlemen out

01:21:19.167 --> 01:21:21.158
I'm sorry to have troubled you

01:21:21.207 --> 01:21:26.440
Don't worry about it,
we're used to following up false trails

01:21:27.447 --> 01:21:31.042
I quite understand
what must be going through your mind

01:21:32.607 --> 01:21:37.158
All these coincidences...
I wanted to be sure in my heart of hearts

01:21:37.207 --> 01:21:39.960
Quite right, and now we are sure

01:21:40.007 --> 01:21:47.118
Speaking of hearts, I'm sure
you'll soon find things looking brighter

01:21:48.007 --> 01:21:52.000
You're young, Doctor,
you have your life before you

01:23:06.807 --> 01:23:11.164
Christiane, put that down

01:23:19.927 --> 01:23:21.724
Why?
