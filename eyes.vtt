WEBVTT

00:00:58.198 --> 00:01:04.494
Eyes without a face

00:06:02.502 --> 00:06:04.429
Professor?

00:06:04.737 --> 00:06:06.595
No, not yet.

00:06:12.412 --> 00:06:14.813
Well, I'll tell him as soon as I'm finished.

00:06:14.814 --> 00:06:17.883
I speak of the new hope given to mankind.

00:06:17.884 --> 00:06:21.745
...the biggest one is no longer recovering your youth.

00:06:22.121 --> 00:06:23.689
...this hope, that

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.424
the heterograph brings us

00:06:26.893 --> 00:06:30.195
The heterogram allows transplantation into humans,

00:06:30.196 --> 00:06:35.501
...of living tissue or organs taken from another human being.

00:06:35.502 --> 00:06:37.569
It wasn't possible until now.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.805
as long as two individuals were found,

00:06:41.107 --> 00:06:44.865
that presented perfect biological identity.

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:48.747
This leads us to modify biologically...

00:06:48.748 --> 00:06:53.712
...the nature of the organism intended to receive the tissue.

00:06:54.187 --> 00:06:58.323
One of the methods consists of

00:06:58.324 --> 00:07:02.027
destroy by strong X-ray radiation

00:07:02.028 --> 00:07:06.788
The antibodies, which make resistance to heterograph.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.497
However, this radiation must be of such intensity

00:07:14.307 --> 00:07:17.303
That humans would not survive.

00:07:18.444 --> 00:07:21.474
We then do the 'exsanguination',

00:07:22.282 --> 00:07:25.851
Removing all the blood, down to the last drop.

00:07:25.852 --> 00:07:27.881
Of the irradiated patient.

00:07:35.395 --> 00:07:39.131
- A call for you, Professor.. - From whom?

00:07:39.132 --> 00:07:42.663
From the Medical Institute, the morgue.

00:07:43.136 --> 00:07:45.804
- They want to see him now. - Professor...

00:07:45.805 --> 00:07:48.874
His lecture was edifying.

00:07:48.875 --> 00:07:51.076
exciting, wasn't it Carlo?

00:07:51.077 --> 00:07:53.645
What a wonderful future we will have!

00:07:53.646 --> 00:07:58.178
The future, ma'am, needs to be thought about very early on.

00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:09.628
How things have changed since his daughter disappeared.

00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:11.829
He says such strange things...

00:08:20.807 --> 00:08:24.474
A strange subject, that's how it seems to me.

00:08:24.777 --> 00:08:28.347
When G�nessier's daughter disappeared from the clinic,

00:08:28.348 --> 00:08:31.483
His face was one big wound.

00:08:31.484 --> 00:08:36.016
The disappearance of the skin confirms your assumption.

00:08:37.156 --> 00:08:39.224
The car accident,

00:08:39.225 --> 00:08:43.195
Deep burns on the face, immersion in water.

00:08:43.196 --> 00:08:46.264
With the rats, Doctor, don't forget the rats.

00:08:46.265 --> 00:08:47.793
True.

00:08:48.534 --> 00:08:53.872
The description of the drowning matches that of Simone Tessot.

00:08:53.873 --> 00:08:56.733
In any case, I called your father.

00:08:58.211 --> 00:09:00.946
Not everything is clear.

00:09:00.947 --> 00:09:05.650
The curious thing is that the body wasn't under a men's bathrobe.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.688
It is not understood why the professor's daughter

00:09:09.689 --> 00:09:12.958
Desperate because she was disfigured by the car accident,

00:09:13.426 --> 00:09:15.360
Wanting to drown, I would feel in the winter,

00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:19.188
The need to undress to jump into the water.

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:25.867
And that hole where the face used to be.

00:09:26.339 --> 00:09:28.273
It's strange...

00:09:28.274 --> 00:09:32.806
The edges are as regular as if they were made with a scalpel.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.579
Oh, that's it.

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:08.146
Dr. Lherminier.

00:10:08.147 --> 00:10:11.348
Detective Parot, from the family search service.

00:10:20.993 --> 00:10:25.787
I feel we met under unpleasant circumstances.

00:10:26.099 --> 00:10:27.499
Explain it to me.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.065
This morning in the Seine, fishermen found the body of a girl.

00:10:31.537 --> 00:10:33.638
The stay in the water corresponds to the time

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:37.705
Miss Genessier's disappearance.

00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:41.246
The description is accurate.

00:10:41.247 --> 00:10:45.449
The face is destroyed, the eyes are intact.

00:10:56.295 --> 00:10:58.995
IDENTIFICATION ROOM

00:11:24.323 --> 00:11:26.181
It's her.

00:11:28.494 --> 00:11:30.421
Christiane.

00:11:39.572 --> 00:11:41.464
Mr. Tessot is here, Doctor.

00:11:41.774 --> 00:11:46.568
Tell him that the identification leaves no doubt, she is not his daughter.

00:11:49.382 --> 00:11:50.979
- I subpoenaed him if... - Yes.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.678
Certainly.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.500
Excuse me, Doctor. I'm Henri Tessot.

00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:11.169
I'm also here for my daughter

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.905
The assistant told me it was yours.

00:12:13.906 --> 00:12:18.043
Excuse me, professor, but are you sure?

00:12:18.044 --> 00:12:21.336
Yes sir, very safe.

00:12:22.048 --> 00:12:25.283
It was a terrible thing when they called...

00:12:25.284 --> 00:12:27.319
I thought I would go crazy.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.056
It's been 10 days since I last saw Simone.

00:12:31.057 --> 00:12:33.917
Something must have happened.

00:12:35.661 --> 00:12:39.598
The strange thing is that I'm the one who should be comforting him.

00:12:39.599 --> 00:12:42.959
Despite everything, he still has hope.

00:13:56.108 --> 00:13:59.639
I'm bored and looking for a room.

00:14:21.167 --> 00:14:23.702
The older he gets, the more he looks like his father.

00:14:23.703 --> 00:14:28.406
Old Genessier wasn't so thin.

00:14:28.708 --> 00:14:31.533
In any case, you are not so lucky.

00:14:32.011 --> 00:14:36.648
He lost his wife 4 years ago, now his daughter...

00:14:36.649 --> 00:14:42.148
Paris, fame, fortune. And now...

00:14:55.468 --> 00:14:57.469
Who is the young man?

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.704
It's the girl's fiancé, a doctor,

00:14:59.705 --> 00:15:03.308
He works with the Professor.

00:15:03.309 --> 00:15:04.876
And the woman?

00:15:04.877 --> 00:15:07.543
Your secretary, it seems.

00:15:07.847 --> 00:15:09.414
A foreigner.

00:15:09.415 --> 00:15:11.945
She looks affected.

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:22.417
Come home, son.

00:15:37.343 --> 00:15:39.411
No, let's not.

00:15:39.412 --> 00:15:41.270
I like order.

00:16:02.134 --> 00:16:05.494
No, come on, I can't anymore.

00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:11.940
Shut up!

00:16:21.821 --> 00:16:25.113
"To my beloved daughter"

00:21:13.078 --> 00:21:15.209
Where did you find this?

00:21:16.248 --> 00:21:18.607
I don't like this habit of snooping.

00:21:21.053 --> 00:21:24.516
I can't explain this to you right now.

00:21:24.656 --> 00:21:27.584
Sure, you see your name in a black square.

00:21:30.028 --> 00:21:33.422
Okay, what do you imagine?

00:21:33.732 --> 00:21:35.800
I don't need to imagine.

00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:39.604
I see horrible things. I live them.

00:21:39.605 --> 00:21:41.773
What have you been doing?

00:21:41.774 --> 00:21:44.008
What did I need to do?

00:21:44.476 --> 00:21:46.505
For your own good.

00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:49.846
Always for your own good, Christiane.

00:21:51.984 --> 00:21:54.013
This is part of it,

00:21:54.653 --> 00:21:58.286
A simple name change.

00:22:03.462 --> 00:22:07.493
After the girl died after the operation.

00:22:08.967 --> 00:22:11.827
My risk has increased.

00:22:12.571 --> 00:22:15.601
I made them believe it was you.

00:22:17.075 --> 00:22:22.438
Once they think you're dead, they won't snoop anymore.

00:22:23.916 --> 00:22:26.776
They will not seek to know what is happening here.

00:22:27.619 --> 00:22:31.022
Christiane, your mask!

00:22:31.023 --> 00:22:35.555
Get into the habit of using it once and for all.

00:22:36.862 --> 00:22:38.763
Where did you hide it?

00:22:38.764 --> 00:22:40.998
Get used to it!

00:22:41.133 --> 00:22:44.368
I mean, get used to it.

00:22:44.369 --> 00:22:48.400
Use it until we succeed.

00:22:49.875 --> 00:22:52.234
Please don't cry, darling.

00:22:54.713 --> 00:22:57.743
I promise I will succeed.

00:22:59.551 --> 00:23:02.411
I don't believe it anymore.

00:23:15.467 --> 00:23:18.327
You have no reason to doubt me.

00:23:19.972 --> 00:23:22.672
God knows what I'm worth, doesn't he?

00:23:24.643 --> 00:23:27.173
It will have a real face.

00:23:27.646 --> 00:23:30.005
I promise.

00:23:36.755 --> 00:23:39.490
You took the mirrors,

00:23:39.491 --> 00:23:42.059
But the glasses reflect me,

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.529
When the windows are open.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.923
Everything has a reflection.

00:23:47.399 --> 00:23:49.428
To calm down, yes, to do it,

00:23:50.002 --> 00:23:51.736
The varnished wood,

00:23:51.737 --> 00:23:54.472
My face scares me.

00:23:54.473 --> 00:23:57.041
And the mask scares me even more.

00:23:57.042 --> 00:23:59.902
Have faith, Christiane.

00:24:01.246 --> 00:24:03.447
Look at me.

00:24:03.448 --> 00:24:05.316
He didn't succeed with me?

00:24:05.317 --> 00:24:07.448
But you had a face.

00:24:07.753 --> 00:24:12.056
Hollowed out perhaps, but not deformed like mine.

00:24:12.057 --> 00:24:15.760
He lies to me because he knows it was his fault.

00:24:15.761 --> 00:24:17.495
Blame?

00:24:17.496 --> 00:24:20.998
A car accident. Chance.

00:24:20.999 --> 00:24:25.503
Perhaps? Your need to control everything, even the road!

00:24:25.504 --> 00:24:28.364
He drove like a madman.

00:24:31.843 --> 00:24:36.546
I was going to die after the accident, why did he do everything for me to live?

00:24:37.015 --> 00:24:40.045
I wish I were blind.

00:24:40.986 --> 00:24:43.015
Dead.

00:28:19.237 --> 00:28:21.095
Who speaks?

00:28:21.406 --> 00:28:23.401
Say something!

00:29:07.886 --> 00:29:10.120
I see you're alone, miss.

00:29:10.121 --> 00:29:12.189
If you want you can take advantage of this entry,

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:15.050
The friend who was with me didn't show up.

00:29:15.527 --> 00:29:17.461
My pleasure, madam.

00:29:17.462 --> 00:29:20.698
I didn't think about buying such an expensive place.

00:29:20.699 --> 00:29:23.490
Don't worry, I'm offering it to you.

00:29:58.436 --> 00:30:01.338
Sorry for the delay, the course has been extended.

00:30:01.339 --> 00:30:03.307
No problem.

00:30:03.308 --> 00:30:07.044
I was eager to give him the good news.

00:30:07.045 --> 00:30:10.109
The room you were looking for, I found it.

00:30:10.582 --> 00:30:14.184
It's impossible! I'm so happy.

00:30:14.185 --> 00:30:15.884
How can I thank you?

00:30:16.855 --> 00:30:20.925
You will do this when you have seen the room, I think you will like it.

00:30:20.926 --> 00:30:22.927
In which neighborhood?

00:30:22.928 --> 00:30:25.287
A very beautiful neighborhood.

00:30:28.066 --> 00:30:30.357
Same for you, miss.

00:30:31.336 --> 00:30:35.673
Come on, I'm in a car, the owners are my friends.

00:30:35.674 --> 00:30:38.101
You'll see, it's full of trees...

00:31:27.092 --> 00:31:29.451
It seems very far away.

00:31:30.295 --> 00:31:32.825
I took a longer route.

00:31:33.298 --> 00:31:36.567
The shortest route is congested at this time.

00:31:49.848 --> 00:31:53.584
This is the train that takes her to Paris every day.

00:31:53.585 --> 00:31:55.819
In less than 20 minutes.

00:31:57.655 --> 00:32:01.658
Don't you feel lonely, so far from your family?

00:32:01.659 --> 00:32:05.190
A little, sometimes.

00:33:22.874 --> 00:33:25.233
These dogs...

00:33:25.877 --> 00:33:27.611
How many are there?

00:33:27.612 --> 00:33:31.473
See? It will be well protected.

00:33:53.838 --> 00:33:56.039
Miss Edna Gruberg.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.075
Sr. Dormeuil.

00:33:58.076 --> 00:34:00.139
Nice to meet you, miss.

00:34:01.146 --> 00:34:04.281
A port to recover from this little trip?

00:34:04.282 --> 00:34:08.043
No, thank you, I don't want to stay long.

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.579
There's no need to rush.

00:34:17.195 --> 00:34:20.225
I will show you your room.

00:34:20.532 --> 00:34:23.100
It overlooks the trees.

00:34:23.101 --> 00:34:24.968
I'm sure you'll like it.

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:27.999
I don't know, I need to think about it.

00:34:31.709 --> 00:34:35.069
First, you should see the room.

00:34:39.384 --> 00:34:42.953
Of course, it's harder to judge at night.

00:34:42.954 --> 00:34:44.380
That's not it,

00:34:44.956 --> 00:34:48.487
But the suburbs are not comfortable for me.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.818
How not?

00:34:51.196 --> 00:34:54.765
The suburb is convenient, very convenient.

00:34:54.766 --> 00:34:57.466
Maybe it is, but...

00:34:57.936 --> 00:35:01.831
I wouldn't like to return to Paris too late.

00:35:03.241 --> 00:35:07.444
I have a meeting with a friend, I'll give you an answer tomorrow...

00:35:07.445 --> 00:35:11.909
Tomorrow will be too late, my little one.

00:36:59.691 --> 00:37:01.549
Abra, r�pido.

00:37:53.845 --> 00:37:55.579
I'll start after dinner.

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.438
But this time,

00:37:58.249 --> 00:38:01.109
I will extract a larger graft.

00:38:03.187 --> 00:38:05.717
In one piece.

00:38:06.357 --> 00:38:09.057
And no cuts.

00:43:24.108 --> 00:43:25.306
L�pis.

00:44:11.188 --> 00:44:12.580
Scalpel

00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:05.103
Dry.

00:45:14.451 --> 00:45:15.649
L�pis.

00:45:38.142 --> 00:45:39.500
Scalpel

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:07.928
Pin�a.

00:48:13.964 --> 00:48:16.164
Let's go again

00:48:37.388 --> 00:48:40.054
We are always the same

00:48:40.224 --> 00:48:42.325
We are enchanted by young girls when they are young

00:48:42.326 --> 00:48:45.061
When they grow too big and eat too much

00:48:45.062 --> 00:48:47.091
They abandon them in the woods

00:48:47.564 --> 00:48:51.994
What I'm saying is that you should never leave things half-done.

00:48:54.638 --> 00:49:00.001
Especially when the first part is easier than the second.

00:49:31.542 --> 00:49:33.070
Calm down

00:49:53.497 --> 00:49:55.355
Calm down

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:15.551
Did she eat normally?

00:50:15.552 --> 00:50:17.453
Yes, he ate very well.

00:50:17.454 --> 00:50:19.922
Before she was wasting away.

00:50:19.923 --> 00:50:22.723
She is happy now, she is confident.

00:50:23.127 --> 00:50:24.451
Finally.

00:50:24.828 --> 00:50:27.830
I showed her that it is healing well.

00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:31.634
I changed the dressing, underneath it is clean, perfect.

00:50:31.635 --> 00:50:33.369
Much better than yesterday.

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:35.304
I'm so scared.

00:50:35.305 --> 00:50:37.406
For no reason, me too.

00:50:37.407 --> 00:50:40.141
I trust this time.

00:50:41.778 --> 00:50:44.239
All to do is wait.

00:50:47.684 --> 00:50:50.520
Such a success, my God.

00:50:50.521 --> 00:50:52.750
It would be priceless!

00:50:54.958 --> 00:50:57.988
I did so many wrong things for this miracle.

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:01.664
And to the same words.

00:51:01.665 --> 00:51:06.766
Certainly, but I will never forget that I owe my face to you.

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.674
Sometimes I forget, me too.

00:51:11.675 --> 00:51:13.276
Tens raz�o

00:51:13.277 --> 00:51:16.137
So few traces remain.

00:51:23.687 --> 00:51:26.717
And Edna, what did you decide?

00:51:27.357 --> 00:51:30.319
Take care of her, feed her.

00:51:31.628 --> 00:51:33.987
I'll decide later.

00:53:27.844 --> 00:53:30.446
Edna! She escaped!

00:53:30.447 --> 00:53:31.679
For there.

00:57:44.267 --> 00:57:47.236
Did any other details catch your attention?

00:57:47.237 --> 00:57:48.936
N�o.

00:57:50.907 --> 00:57:53.142
Try!

00:57:53.143 --> 00:57:56.935
Edna told me that the woman was wearing a thick pearl necklace.

00:57:57.581 --> 00:57:59.982
See what I mean?

00:57:59.983 --> 00:58:03.013
A wide, very tight necklace.

00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:09.520
Well, that doesn't help much, thanks.

00:58:12.195 --> 00:58:14.053
Please sign.

00:58:19.536 --> 00:58:21.895
You're free, miss.

00:58:38.555 --> 00:58:40.584
Nice girl, isn't she?

00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:43.249
Always a series of "blue-eyed girls".

00:58:44.561 --> 00:58:50.299
All students, the same age, and the same type of beauty.

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.701
And all mysteriously disappeared.

00:58:52.702 --> 00:58:56.403
This is Switzerland. Imagine the phone calls from the embassies.

00:58:58.541 --> 00:59:02.444
Speaking of blue-eyed girls,

00:59:02.445 --> 00:59:05.014
What do I do with mine?

00:59:05.015 --> 00:59:07.875
He stole junk from a store.

00:59:09.352 --> 00:59:11.754
Give her a scolding and let her go

00:59:11.755 --> 00:59:15.957
Get her address, you might need it.

00:59:21.865 --> 00:59:24.998
That's how you end up in prison.

00:59:25.301 --> 00:59:27.302
It was the first time.

00:59:27.303 --> 00:59:29.298
I don't know what went through my head.

00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:32.708
Next time it's cane.

00:59:33.009 --> 00:59:34.743
Give me your address.

00:59:34.744 --> 00:59:38.207
Rua Pyr�n�es, 12. 20E.

00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:41.207
Get out of here now.

00:59:53.163 --> 00:59:55.863
I knew it would work.

00:59:59.069 --> 01:00:01.769
And say you don't doubt me.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.199
Now you have a beautiful face.

01:00:07.677 --> 01:00:09.308
His true face.

01:00:11.314 --> 01:00:13.980
You will be able to revive.

01:00:15.251 --> 01:00:16.609
It's true.

01:00:17.253 --> 01:00:20.549
But I need to be resurrected for other people.

01:00:21.224 --> 01:00:22.923
How will I do it?

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.621
To begin with, you will take a long trip.

01:00:28.998 --> 01:00:31.163
I'll get the documents for you.

01:00:32.635 --> 01:00:34.903
You can choose a name.

01:00:35.805 --> 01:00:37.504
This will be fun.

01:00:38.108 --> 01:00:39.807
A new face,

01:00:40.543 --> 01:00:42.401
A new identity.

01:00:42.712 --> 01:00:46.072
You are more beautiful than you were.

01:00:46.783 --> 01:00:50.450
With an angelic air that you didn't have before.

01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:55.853
Angelic... I don't know.

01:00:57.327 --> 01:01:01.296
In front of a mirror...

01:01:01.297 --> 01:01:03.155
It feels like I'm in front of someone who looks like me.

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:07.294
That comes from afar.

01:01:07.771 --> 01:01:09.629
Very far away

01:01:10.073 --> 01:01:11.772
E Jacques?

01:01:17.147 --> 01:01:21.178
Sure, this is a problem.

01:01:22.485 --> 01:01:24.844
I will explain to him.

01:01:26.489 --> 01:01:28.780
He loves you very much.

01:01:31.094 --> 01:01:33.453
He will be very happy.

01:01:34.898 --> 01:01:36.096
He used to smile.

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:38.698
He used to smile.

01:01:40.103 --> 01:01:41.961
Not so much.

01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:05.060
Give him Pentothal. I'll be right there.

01:02:08.531 --> 01:02:10.526
Another emergency.

01:02:12.869 --> 01:02:16.070
Come with me. I'm sorry, darling.

01:02:38.361 --> 01:02:40.219
Don't wear makeup anymore.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.158
Porqu�?

01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:49.201
No reason.

01:02:49.939 --> 01:02:52.969
She's naturally beautiful, that's why.

01:02:55.111 --> 01:02:57.311
See you tomorrow, dear.

01:03:03.419 --> 01:03:07.280
I won't be long, I'll be back to say goodnight.

01:03:18.101 --> 01:03:20.302
You look worried.

01:03:20.303 --> 01:03:23.970
Nothing, your imagination.

01:03:25.942 --> 01:03:27.709
Why are you lying?

01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:31.502
After so long I can read your face

01:03:32.115 --> 01:03:33.848
Tell me the truth.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.087
He is lost.

01:03:53.803 --> 01:03:55.661
February 15th.

01:03:56.606 --> 01:03:58.464
February 20th.

01:03:59.809 --> 01:04:04.671
A week after healing, small subcutaneous spots appear.

01:04:06.115 --> 01:04:12.149
Later, palpation reveals small subcutaneous nodules.

01:04:14.590 --> 01:04:19.759
On the 12th day, necrosis of the transplanted tissue is clear.

01:04:21.297 --> 01:04:23.189
Vig�simo...

01:04:24.167 --> 01:04:30.702
First ulcerations accompanied by skin detachment and infection.

01:04:31.341 --> 01:04:34.542
And the necrotic transplant needs to be removed.

01:05:09.479 --> 01:05:14.341
With an older dog, anything is possible.

01:05:16.886 --> 01:05:21.919
It is necessary to satisfy the pack.

01:06:16.112 --> 01:06:18.312
I'm listening.

01:06:20.316 --> 01:06:22.050
Home!

01:06:22.051 --> 01:06:23.909
This is annoying!

01:06:25.488 --> 01:06:26.686
Say something!

01:06:28.391 --> 01:06:30.056
Jacques...

01:06:41.304 --> 01:06:44.072
Are you crazy? Who did you call?

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.700
Ningu�m.

01:06:45.975 --> 01:06:48.607
Do you realize how reckless you were?

01:06:49.245 --> 01:06:52.147
I know, the dead must be silent.

01:06:52.148 --> 01:06:55.008
So I died to the good things.

01:06:55.518 --> 01:06:57.217
I can't take it anymore!

01:06:57.854 --> 01:07:00.281
I can no longer see myself.

01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:03.190
I can't touch my face anymore.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.896
I'm afraid of feeling grooves and cracks

01:07:07.897 --> 01:07:11.462
Pale as a tripe.

01:07:13.169 --> 01:07:16.972
Calm down, my dear. Have confidence.

01:07:16.973 --> 01:07:18.831
He'll succeed, I'm sure of it.

01:07:19.475 --> 01:07:22.177
That's a lie, he'll never succeed.

01:07:22.178 --> 01:07:25.038
He will continue to experiment on me as if I were one of his dogs.

01:07:25.348 --> 01:07:28.276
A human guinea pig, good for him!

01:07:28.751 --> 01:07:30.780
You have no right to say that.

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:34.450
I want to die, I beg you!

01:07:34.924 --> 01:07:39.957
Those shots he gives the dogs when he's finished. Mercy.

01:07:42.398 --> 01:07:43.926
Hold back!

01:07:44.367 --> 01:07:48.228
You have to kill me. I can't do it anymore!

01:07:56.579 --> 01:07:58.608
Hello? Come quickly!

01:07:59.916 --> 01:08:02.651
I'm sure I heard Christiane's voice.

01:08:02.652 --> 01:08:06.353
You think you heard, especially on the phone.

01:08:06.756 --> 01:08:08.990
Did you tell Professor G�nessier about this?

01:08:08.991 --> 01:08:12.761
Of course. But he insisted that he recognized his daughter's body.

01:08:12.762 --> 01:08:14.893
I know, I was there.

01:08:15.364 --> 01:08:17.222
What can I tell you?

01:08:17.533 --> 01:08:20.199
It may have been a bad joke.

01:08:21.003 --> 01:08:22.504
He can...

01:08:22.505 --> 01:08:25.706
Doctor, I only work with accurate facts.

01:08:26.108 --> 01:08:28.810
Here I have the testimonies...

01:08:28.811 --> 01:08:32.512
'I think that', 'It seems to me that'...

01:08:32.982 --> 01:08:35.383
Vague things.

01:08:35.384 --> 01:08:37.586
"A red taxi arrived."

01:08:37.587 --> 01:08:41.389
"A beautiful woman with a pearl necklace."

01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:43.681
"That accompanied the other."

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.255
A pearl dog collar?

01:08:49.765 --> 01:08:52.133
Does this remind you of anything?

01:08:52.134 --> 01:08:53.992
Wait.

01:08:55.471 --> 01:08:58.433
Yes, it reminds me of someone.

01:09:31.807 --> 01:09:34.632
You told me it was all over.

01:09:34.944 --> 01:09:38.543
I expected that, Miss Paulette M�rodon,

01:09:38.848 --> 01:09:41.616
But the case went its way and...

01:09:41.617 --> 01:09:43.646
They found me too lenient.

01:09:46.455 --> 01:09:49.815
If I understand correctly, I'm registered...

01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:54.425
- � a pris�o. - N�o, o tribunal.

01:09:54.897 --> 01:09:56.926
O tribunal!

01:09:59.235 --> 01:10:02.003
From what I know of my parents, they won't like it.

01:10:03.472 --> 01:10:05.603
I thought of something.

01:10:06.075 --> 01:10:09.435
There would be a way to avoid all this.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.442
But it would require a lot of discretion...

01:10:15.051 --> 01:10:16.785
and some intelligence.

01:10:16.786 --> 01:10:20.487
I am very, very discreet, and also intelligent!

01:10:20.956 --> 01:10:22.691
Anyway, if it's not complicated...

01:10:22.692 --> 01:10:24.659
Voc� ver�

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:27.562
It will only be a small service that he will do for us.

01:10:27.563 --> 01:10:32.067
- What do I have to do? - Bleach my hair, for starters.

01:10:32.068 --> 01:10:35.929
- You're kidding. - That's not our standard.

01:10:36.572 --> 01:10:39.602
We need you to be blonder.

01:10:39.909 --> 01:10:42.310
- I don't know if I'll be okay. - It doesn't matter.

01:10:42.311 --> 01:10:46.715
You will go to a doctor and he will admit you.

01:10:46.716 --> 01:10:49.746
- I'm not sick! - He'll say he is.

01:10:50.386 --> 01:10:53.246
Fill her in on the details.

01:10:53.723 --> 01:10:56.958
At the clinic, you will complain of headaches.

01:10:56.959 --> 01:10:59.227
I'll write everything down for you.

01:10:59.695 --> 01:11:02.395
Falar� com Dr. Gleize.

01:11:06.035 --> 01:11:08.799
He will send a letter to Dr. G�nessier

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.905
Hello? Dr. Jaque Vernon?

01:11:10.906 --> 01:11:12.605
Yes, it's me.

01:11:16.912 --> 01:11:18.770
What did you say?

01:11:19.248 --> 01:11:21.277
Wait, I'll write it down.

01:11:28.624 --> 01:11:31.484
I think she will be able to come in tomorrow morning.

01:11:33.262 --> 01:11:36.164
Rest assured, I won't lose sight of you.

01:11:36.165 --> 01:11:39.366
Just for a hypothesis.

01:11:42.004 --> 01:11:46.206
If something happens, I'll let you know immediately.

01:12:04.527 --> 01:12:06.094
Are you behaving well?

01:12:06.095 --> 01:12:07.953
Very good, doctor.

01:12:15.604 --> 01:12:18.173
Miss arrived this morning.

01:12:18.174 --> 01:12:20.533
- Who is treating her? - Dr. Gleize.

01:12:21.343 --> 01:12:23.201
See the letter.

01:12:29.385 --> 01:12:31.243
Are you experiencing a lot of pain?

01:12:32.721 --> 01:12:34.289
Try.

01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:36.922
Well, sometimes...

01:12:39.562 --> 01:12:45.095
We will perform a fundus examination and an electroencephalogram.

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:47.100
Doctor

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:49.799
Are they going to shave my head?

01:12:50.107 --> 01:12:53.675
I hope not.

01:12:53.676 --> 01:12:55.705
It would be a shame.

01:13:03.052 --> 01:13:08.119
An Electro... encephalogram...

01:13:25.708 --> 01:13:27.566
Don't be afraid.

01:13:28.043 --> 01:13:30.243
We are not friends.

01:13:30.713 --> 01:13:32.981
Don't touch your face.

01:13:35.885 --> 01:13:38.415
Tell me how many fingers are there?

01:13:53.168 --> 01:13:54.799
Tr�s.

01:13:58.774 --> 01:14:01.634
And now, how many?

01:14:03.612 --> 01:14:04.970
Tr�s

01:14:06.549 --> 01:14:09.340
No, two.

01:14:39.949 --> 01:14:42.684
So doctor, what do you think?

01:14:42.685 --> 01:14:44.543
I am hopeful.

01:14:46.689 --> 01:14:48.923
Tell me, Doctor.

01:14:49.925 --> 01:14:51.326
Did you save him?

01:14:51.327 --> 01:14:53.185
Certainly.

01:14:53.996 --> 01:14:55.854
Have confidence. Let's go!

01:15:01.637 --> 01:15:03.638
What is your prognosis?

01:15:03.639 --> 01:15:05.497
And you?

01:15:06.241 --> 01:15:08.099
We agree.

01:15:14.817 --> 01:15:16.675
Close your eyes.

01:15:18.587 --> 01:15:20.650
Open your eyes.

01:15:33.335 --> 01:15:36.035
It's over, open your eyes.

01:15:39.842 --> 01:15:43.543
We will do an electrical stimulation, it won't hurt.

01:15:44.847 --> 01:15:46.705
N�o mexa a cabe�a.

01:15:58.027 --> 01:15:59.385
Close.

01:16:03.365 --> 01:16:05.064
Continue.

01:16:08.871 --> 01:16:10.729
Open your eyes.

01:16:11.507 --> 01:16:13.365
Close.

01:16:36.732 --> 01:16:39.796
Bring me the exam when you're done.

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:55.111
Nothing suspicious about Paulette Mordon.

01:17:09.331 --> 01:17:12.191
Sir, 15 is hemorrhaging.

01:17:12.668 --> 01:17:14.993
Take care of this case, Jacques.

01:17:56.311 --> 01:17:58.340
Here is the exam, sir.

01:18:02.818 --> 01:18:05.848
No changes, everything is fine.

01:18:06.488 --> 01:18:08.723
Release her tonight,

01:18:08.724 --> 01:18:10.924
thus freeing up the bed.

01:18:11.393 --> 01:18:14.423
We may have an emergency at night.

01:18:37.186 --> 01:18:40.755
- Should I hand this to you? - Yes, thank you.

01:18:40.756 --> 01:18:43.786
- Can I call? - Yes, to Paris?

01:18:44.259 --> 01:18:47.585
- What is the number? - Botzaris 4844.

01:18:58.373 --> 01:19:00.942
M�e? � Paulette.

01:19:00.943 --> 01:19:03.511
Everything is fine. I'm going.

01:19:03.512 --> 01:19:05.279
At� logo.

01:19:05.914 --> 01:19:08.182
- How much do I owe? - Nothing.

01:19:08.483 --> 01:19:10.952
How do I get back to Paris?

01:19:10.953 --> 01:19:15.485
By bus, exit on the left, about 15 minutes.

01:19:42.618 --> 01:19:47.021
I can take you, miss, I'll go in your direction.

01:19:47.022 --> 01:19:48.880
With pleasure, madam.

01:20:02.771 --> 01:20:04.629
Inspector Parot?

01:20:05.107 --> 01:20:07.375
� Jacques Vernon.

01:20:09.177 --> 01:20:10.910
As a Doctor?

01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.481
Has she left yet?

01:20:13.482 --> 01:20:16.012
He did not linger in his clinic.

01:20:16.752 --> 01:20:19.282
It cannot be said that they were kidnapped.

01:20:21.957 --> 01:20:23.986
And what did you say?

01:20:24.293 --> 01:20:27.494
Let's make sure she comes back okay.

01:20:27.629 --> 01:20:30.159
Thank you for letting us know, doctor.

01:20:47.649 --> 01:20:50.184
Two gentlemen are looking for you.

01:20:50.185 --> 01:20:52.350
But I don't have time.

01:20:52.988 --> 01:20:54.846
Tell them to come back tomorrow.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.848
We feel uncomfortable at this hour.

01:22:27.849 --> 01:22:33.052
We would like to know if Miss M�rodon left the clinic this evening.

01:22:34.523 --> 01:22:36.848
How did they know she left?

01:22:37.159 --> 01:22:40.961
He called his mother to let her know he was coming back.

01:22:40.962 --> 01:22:44.365
And she didn't come home.

01:22:44.366 --> 01:22:46.896
So we came here to check.

01:22:48.203 --> 01:22:50.562
Checking this is easy.

01:22:51.039 --> 01:22:54.399
I gave the order to release this patient.

01:22:55.877 --> 01:23:00.409
- Paulette M�rodon left? - I'll see you, sir.

01:23:03.218 --> 01:23:06.919
So, are you interested in this young woman?

01:23:07.956 --> 01:23:11.987
She is involved in a very complicated case.

01:23:12.461 --> 01:23:14.956
We wanted to see you tonight.

01:23:16.098 --> 01:23:19.567
I would say they arrived late.

01:23:19.568 --> 01:23:22.268
Paulette M�rodon. Here it is.

01:23:22.904 --> 01:23:28.175
Now I remember, a girl with light eyes, she made a call from here.

01:23:28.176 --> 01:23:30.876
I told her she could take the bus.

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:34.038
Did you see?

01:23:34.516 --> 01:23:36.374
I am really sorry,

01:23:37.018 --> 01:23:38.986
But after they pass through the door,

01:23:38.987 --> 01:23:41.619
The patients are no longer my responsibility.

01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:44.654
Yes, of course, I understand.

01:23:45.127 --> 01:23:48.453
Once again, sorry for the inconvenience.

01:23:49.097 --> 01:23:51.297
Not for that reason.

01:23:59.741 --> 01:24:02.566
- Good evening, Professor. - Good evening.

01:24:03.912 --> 01:24:08.615
Jacques, you are leaving, please accompany the gentlemen.

01:24:35.544 --> 01:24:37.845
I apologize for the pointless work.

01:24:37.846 --> 01:24:39.704
No problem, doctor, we are

01:24:40.415 --> 01:24:43.309
accustomed to false leads.

01:24:44.452 --> 01:24:48.210
I put myself in your shoes, I'm starting to get ideas.

01:24:49.691 --> 01:24:52.393
Yes, so many coincidences.

01:24:52.394 --> 01:24:54.528
It would be best to get your head straight.

01:24:54.529 --> 01:24:57.229
After this, it's even better.

01:24:57.866 --> 01:25:00.000
And speaking of the heart,

01:25:00.001 --> 01:25:05.034
I'm sure everything will work out on this side.

01:25:05.674 --> 01:25:08.075
You are young, Doctor.

01:25:08.076 --> 01:25:10.539
You have your whole life ahead of you.

01:26:28.456 --> 01:26:30.314
Drop it!

01:26:41.503 --> 01:26:43.202
Why this?
