1
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:04,494
Eyes without a face

2
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:04,429
Professor?

3
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:06,595
No, not yet.

4
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:14,813
Well, I'll tell him as soon as I'm finished.

5
00:06:14,814 --> 00:06:17,883
I speak of the new hope given to mankind.

6
00:06:17,884 --> 00:06:21,745
...the biggest one is no longer recovering your youth.

7
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:23,689
...this hope, that

8
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,424
the heterograph brings us

9
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:30,195
The heterogram allows transplantation into humans,

10
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:35,501
...of living tissue or organs taken from another human being.

11
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:37,569
It wasn't possible until now.

12
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,805
as long as two individuals were found,

13
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:44,865
that presented perfect biological identity.

14
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:48,747
This leads us to modify biologically...

15
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:53,712
...the nature of the organism intended to receive the tissue.

16
00:06:54,187 --> 00:06:58,323
One of the methods consists of

17
00:06:58,324 --> 00:07:02,027
destroy by strong X-ray radiation

18
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:06,788
The antibodies, which make resistance to heterograph.

19
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,497
However, this radiation must be of such intensity

20
00:07:14,307 --> 00:07:17,303
That humans would not survive.

21
00:07:18,444 --> 00:07:21,474
We then do the 'exsanguination',

22
00:07:22,282 --> 00:07:25,851
Removing all the blood, down to the last drop.

23
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:27,881
Of the irradiated patient.

24
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:39,131
- A call for you, Professor.. - From whom?

25
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:42,663
From the Medical Institute, the morgue.

26
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:45,804
- They want to see him now. - Professor...

27
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:48,874
His lecture was edifying.

28
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,076
exciting, wasn't it Carlo?

29
00:07:51,077 --> 00:07:53,645
What a wonderful future we will have!

30
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:58,178
The future, ma'am, needs to be thought about very early on.

31
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,628
How things have changed since his daughter disappeared.

32
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:11,829
He says such strange things...

33
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:24,474
A strange subject, that's how it seems to me.

34
00:08:24,777 --> 00:08:28,347
When G�nessier's daughter disappeared from the clinic,

35
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:31,483
His face was one big wound.

36
00:08:31,484 --> 00:08:36,016
The disappearance of the skin confirms your assumption.

37
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:39,224
The car accident,

38
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:43,195
Deep burns on the face, immersion in water.

39
00:08:43,196 --> 00:08:46,264
With the rats, Doctor, don't forget the rats.

40
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:47,793
True.

41
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:53,872
The description of the drowning matches that of Simone Tessot.

42
00:08:53,873 --> 00:08:56,733
In any case, I called your father.

43
00:08:58,211 --> 00:09:00,946
Not everything is clear.

44
00:09:00,947 --> 00:09:05,650
The curious thing is that the body wasn't under a men's bathrobe.

45
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,688
It is not understood why the professor's daughter

46
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:12,958
Desperate because she was disfigured by the car accident,

47
00:09:13,426 --> 00:09:15,360
Wanting to drown, I would feel in the winter,

48
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:19,188
The need to undress to jump into the water.

49
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:25,867
And that hole where the face used to be.

50
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,273
It's strange...

51
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:32,806
The edges are as regular as if they were made with a scalpel.

52
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,579
Oh, that's it.

53
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:08,146
Dr. Lherminier.

54
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:11,348
Detective Parot, from the family search service.

55
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:25,787
I feel we met under unpleasant circumstances.

56
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:27,499
Explain it to me.

57
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,065
This morning in the Seine, fishermen found the body of a girl.

58
00:10:31,537 --> 00:10:33,638
The stay in the water corresponds to the time

59
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:37,705
Miss Genessier's disappearance.

60
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:41,246
The description is accurate.

61
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:45,449
The face is destroyed, the eyes are intact.

62
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:58,995
IDENTIFICATION ROOM

63
00:11:24,323 --> 00:11:26,181
It's her.

64
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:30,421
Christiane.

65
00:11:39,572 --> 00:11:41,464
Mr. Tessot is here, Doctor.

66
00:11:41,774 --> 00:11:46,568
Tell him that the identification leaves no doubt, she is not his daughter.

67
00:11:49,382 --> 00:11:50,979
- I subpoenaed him if... - Yes.

68
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,678
Certainly.

69
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,500
Excuse me, Doctor. I'm Henri Tessot.

70
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:11,169
I'm also here for my daughter

71
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,905
The assistant told me it was yours.

72
00:12:13,906 --> 00:12:18,043
Excuse me, professor, but are you sure?

73
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:21,336
Yes sir, very safe.

74
00:12:22,048 --> 00:12:25,283
It was a terrible thing when they called...

75
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:27,319
I thought I would go crazy.

76
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,056
It's been 10 days since I last saw Simone.

77
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:33,917
Something must have happened.

78
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:39,598
The strange thing is that I'm the one who should be comforting him.

79
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:42,959
Despite everything, he still has hope.

80
00:13:56,108 --> 00:13:59,639
I'm bored and looking for a room.

81
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:23,702
The older he gets, the more he looks like his father.

82
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:28,406
Old Genessier wasn't so thin.

83
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,533
In any case, you are not so lucky.

84
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:36,648
He lost his wife 4 years ago, now his daughter...

85
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:42,148
Paris, fame, fortune. And now...

86
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:57,469
Who is the young man?

87
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,704
It's the girl's fiancé, a doctor,

88
00:14:59,705 --> 00:15:03,308
He works with the Professor.

89
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:04,876
And the woman?

90
00:15:04,877 --> 00:15:07,543
Your secretary, it seems.

91
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:09,414
A foreigner.

92
00:15:09,415 --> 00:15:11,945
She looks affected.

93
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,417
Come home, son.

94
00:15:37,343 --> 00:15:39,411
No, let's not.

95
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:41,270
I like order.

96
00:16:02,134 --> 00:16:05,494
No, come on, I can't anymore.

97
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:11,940
Shut up!

98
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:25,113
"To my beloved daughter"

99
00:21:13,078 --> 00:21:15,209
Where did you find this?

100
00:21:16,248 --> 00:21:18,607
I don't like this habit of snooping.

101
00:21:21,053 --> 00:21:24,516
I can't explain this to you right now.

102
00:21:24,656 --> 00:21:27,584
Sure, you see your name in a black square.

103
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:33,422
Okay, what do you imagine?

104
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:35,800
I don't need to imagine.

105
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:39,604
I see horrible things. I live them.

106
00:21:39,605 --> 00:21:41,773
What have you been doing?

107
00:21:41,774 --> 00:21:44,008
What did I need to do?

108
00:21:44,476 --> 00:21:46,505
For your own good.

109
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:49,846
Always for your own good, Christiane.

110
00:21:51,984 --> 00:21:54,013
This is part of it,

111
00:21:54,653 --> 00:21:58,286
A simple name change.

112
00:22:03,462 --> 00:22:07,493
After the girl died after the operation.

113
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:11,827
My risk has increased.

114
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:15,601
I made them believe it was you.

115
00:22:17,075 --> 00:22:22,438
Once they think you're dead, they won't snoop anymore.

116
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,776
They will not seek to know what is happening here.

117
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:31,022
Christiane, your mask!

118
00:22:31,023 --> 00:22:35,555
Get into the habit of using it once and for all.

119
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:38,763
Where did you hide it?

120
00:22:38,764 --> 00:22:40,998
Get used to it!

121
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:44,368
I mean, get used to it.

122
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:48,400
Use it until we succeed.

123
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,234
Please don't cry, darling.

124
00:22:54,713 --> 00:22:57,743
I promise I will succeed.

125
00:22:59,551 --> 00:23:02,411
I don't believe it anymore.

126
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:18,327
You have no reason to doubt me.

127
00:23:19,972 --> 00:23:22,672
God knows what I'm worth, doesn't he?

128
00:23:24,643 --> 00:23:27,173
It will have a real face.

129
00:23:27,646 --> 00:23:30,005
I promise.

130
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:39,490
You took the mirrors,

131
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:42,059
But the glasses reflect me,

132
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,529
When the windows are open.

133
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,923
Everything has a reflection.

134
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:49,428
To calm down, yes, to do it,

135
00:23:50,002 --> 00:23:51,736
The varnished wood,

136
00:23:51,737 --> 00:23:54,472
My face scares me.

137
00:23:54,473 --> 00:23:57,041
And the mask scares me even more.

138
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:59,902
Have faith, Christiane.

139
00:24:01,246 --> 00:24:03,447
Look at me.

140
00:24:03,448 --> 00:24:05,316
He didn't succeed with me?

141
00:24:05,317 --> 00:24:07,448
But you had a face.

142
00:24:07,753 --> 00:24:12,056
Hollowed out perhaps, but not deformed like mine.

143
00:24:12,057 --> 00:24:15,760
He lies to me because he knows it was his fault.

144
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:17,495
Blame?

145
00:24:17,496 --> 00:24:20,998
A car accident. Chance.

146
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:25,503
Perhaps? Your need to control everything, even the road!

147
00:24:25,504 --> 00:24:28,364
He drove like a madman.

148
00:24:31,843 --> 00:24:36,546
I was going to die after the accident, why did he do everything for me to live?

149
00:24:37,015 --> 00:24:40,045
I wish I were blind.

150
00:24:40,986 --> 00:24:43,015
Dead.

151
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:21,095
Who speaks?

152
00:28:21,406 --> 00:28:23,401
Say something!

153
00:29:07,886 --> 00:29:10,120
I see you're alone, miss.

154
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:12,189
If you want you can take advantage of this entry,

155
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:15,050
The friend who was with me didn't show up.

156
00:29:15,527 --> 00:29:17,461
My pleasure, madam.

157
00:29:17,462 --> 00:29:20,698
I didn't think about buying such an expensive place.

158
00:29:20,699 --> 00:29:23,490
Don't worry, I'm offering it to you.

159
00:29:58,436 --> 00:30:01,338
Sorry for the delay, the course has been extended.

160
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:03,307
No problem.

161
00:30:03,308 --> 00:30:07,044
I was eager to give him the good news.

162
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:10,109
The room you were looking for, I found it.

163
00:30:10,582 --> 00:30:14,184
It's impossible! I'm so happy.

164
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:15,884
How can I thank you?

165
00:30:16,855 --> 00:30:20,925
You will do this when you have seen the room, I think you will like it.

166
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:22,927
In which neighborhood?

167
00:30:22,928 --> 00:30:25,287
A very beautiful neighborhood.

168
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:30,357
Same for you, miss.

169
00:30:31,336 --> 00:30:35,673
Come on, I'm in a car, the owners are my friends.

170
00:30:35,674 --> 00:30:38,101
You'll see, it's full of trees...

171
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:29,451
It seems very far away.

172
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:32,825
I took a longer route.

173
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:36,567
The shortest route is congested at this time.

174
00:31:49,848 --> 00:31:53,584
This is the train that takes her to Paris every day.

175
00:31:53,585 --> 00:31:55,819
In less than 20 minutes.

176
00:31:57,655 --> 00:32:01,658
Don't you feel lonely, so far from your family?

177
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:05,190
A little, sometimes.

178
00:33:22,874 --> 00:33:25,233
These dogs...

179
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:27,611
How many are there?

180
00:33:27,612 --> 00:33:31,473
See? It will be well protected.

181
00:33:53,838 --> 00:33:56,039
Miss Edna Gruberg.

182
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,075
Sr. Dormeuil.

183
00:33:58,076 --> 00:34:00,139
Nice to meet you, miss.

184
00:34:01,146 --> 00:34:04,281
A port to recover from this little trip?

185
00:34:04,282 --> 00:34:08,043
No, thank you, I don't want to stay long.

186
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,579
There's no need to rush.

187
00:34:17,195 --> 00:34:20,225
I will show you your room.

188
00:34:20,532 --> 00:34:23,100
It overlooks the trees.

189
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:24,968
I'm sure you'll like it.

190
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:27,999
I don't know, I need to think about it.

191
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:35,069
First, you should see the room.

192
00:34:39,384 --> 00:34:42,953
Of course, it's harder to judge at night.

193
00:34:42,954 --> 00:34:44,380
That's not it,

194
00:34:44,956 --> 00:34:48,487
But the suburbs are not comfortable for me.

195
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,818
How not?

196
00:34:51,196 --> 00:34:54,765
The suburb is convenient, very convenient.

197
00:34:54,766 --> 00:34:57,466
Maybe it is, but...

198
00:34:57,936 --> 00:35:01,831
I wouldn't like to return to Paris too late.

199
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:07,444
I have a meeting with a friend, I'll give you an answer tomorrow...

200
00:35:07,445 --> 00:35:11,909
Tomorrow will be too late, my little one.

201
00:36:59,691 --> 00:37:01,549
Abra, r�pido.

202
00:37:53,845 --> 00:37:55,579
I'll start after dinner.

203
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,438
But this time,

204
00:37:58,249 --> 00:38:01,109
I will extract a larger graft.

205
00:38:03,187 --> 00:38:05,717
In one piece.

206
00:38:06,357 --> 00:38:09,057
And no cuts.

207
00:43:24,108 --> 00:43:25,306
L�pis.

208
00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:12,580
Scalpel

209
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:05,103
Dry.

210
00:45:14,451 --> 00:45:15,649
L�pis.

211
00:45:38,142 --> 00:45:39,500
Scalpel

212
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:07,928
Pin�a.

213
00:48:13,964 --> 00:48:16,164
Let's go again

214
00:48:37,388 --> 00:48:40,054
We are always the same

215
00:48:40,224 --> 00:48:42,325
We are enchanted by young girls when they are young

216
00:48:42,326 --> 00:48:45,061
When they grow too big and eat too much

217
00:48:45,062 --> 00:48:47,091
They abandon them in the woods

218
00:48:47,564 --> 00:48:51,994
What I'm saying is that you should never leave things half-done.

219
00:48:54,638 --> 00:49:00,001
Especially when the first part is easier than the second.

220
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:33,070
Calm down

221
00:49:53,497 --> 00:49:55,355
Calm down

222
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,551
Did she eat normally?

223
00:50:15,552 --> 00:50:17,453
Yes, he ate very well.

224
00:50:17,454 --> 00:50:19,922
Before she was wasting away.

225
00:50:19,923 --> 00:50:22,723
She is happy now, she is confident.

226
00:50:23,127 --> 00:50:24,451
Finally.

227
00:50:24,828 --> 00:50:27,830
I showed her that it is healing well.

228
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:31,634
I changed the dressing, underneath it is clean, perfect.

229
00:50:31,635 --> 00:50:33,369
Much better than yesterday.

230
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:35,304
I'm so scared.

231
00:50:35,305 --> 00:50:37,406
For no reason, me too.

232
00:50:37,407 --> 00:50:40,141
I trust this time.

233
00:50:41,778 --> 00:50:44,239
All to do is wait.

234
00:50:47,684 --> 00:50:50,520
Such a success, my God.

235
00:50:50,521 --> 00:50:52,750
It would be priceless!

236
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:57,988
I did so many wrong things for this miracle.

237
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,664
And to the same words.

238
00:51:01,665 --> 00:51:06,766
Certainly, but I will never forget that I owe my face to you.

239
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,674
Sometimes I forget, me too.

240
00:51:11,675 --> 00:51:13,276
Tens raz�o

241
00:51:13,277 --> 00:51:16,137
So few traces remain.

242
00:51:23,687 --> 00:51:26,717
And Edna, what did you decide?

243
00:51:27,357 --> 00:51:30,319
Take care of her, feed her.

244
00:51:31,628 --> 00:51:33,987
I'll decide later.

245
00:53:27,844 --> 00:53:30,446
Edna! She escaped!

246
00:53:30,447 --> 00:53:31,679
For there.

247
00:57:44,267 --> 00:57:47,236
Did any other details catch your attention?

248
00:57:47,237 --> 00:57:48,936
N�o.

249
00:57:50,907 --> 00:57:53,142
Try!

250
00:57:53,143 --> 00:57:56,935
Edna told me that the woman was wearing a thick pearl necklace.

251
00:57:57,581 --> 00:57:59,982
See what I mean?

252
00:57:59,983 --> 00:58:03,013
A wide, very tight necklace.

253
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,520
Well, that doesn't help much, thanks.

254
00:58:12,195 --> 00:58:14,053
Please sign.

255
00:58:19,536 --> 00:58:21,895
You're free, miss.

256
00:58:38,555 --> 00:58:40,584
Nice girl, isn't she?

257
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:43,249
Always a series of "blue-eyed girls".

258
00:58:44,561 --> 00:58:50,299
All students, the same age, and the same type of beauty.

259
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,701
And all mysteriously disappeared.

260
00:58:52,702 --> 00:58:56,403
This is Switzerland. Imagine the phone calls from the embassies.

261
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:02,444
Speaking of blue-eyed girls,

262
00:59:02,445 --> 00:59:05,014
What do I do with mine?

263
00:59:05,015 --> 00:59:07,875
He stole junk from a store.

264
00:59:09,352 --> 00:59:11,754
Give her a scolding and let her go

265
00:59:11,755 --> 00:59:15,957
Get her address, you might need it.

266
00:59:21,865 --> 00:59:24,998
That's how you end up in prison.

267
00:59:25,301 --> 00:59:27,302
It was the first time.

268
00:59:27,303 --> 00:59:29,298
I don't know what went through my head.

269
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,708
Next time it's cane.

270
00:59:33,009 --> 00:59:34,743
Give me your address.

271
00:59:34,744 --> 00:59:38,207
Rua Pyr�n�es, 12. 20E.

272
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:41,207
Get out of here now.

273
00:59:53,163 --> 00:59:55,863
I knew it would work.

274
00:59:59,069 --> 01:00:01,769
And say you don't doubt me.

275
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,199
Now you have a beautiful face.

276
01:00:07,677 --> 01:00:09,308
His true face.

277
01:00:11,314 --> 01:00:13,980
You will be able to revive.

278
01:00:15,251 --> 01:00:16,609
It's true.

279
01:00:17,253 --> 01:00:20,549
But I need to be resurrected for other people.

280
01:00:21,224 --> 01:00:22,923
How will I do it?

281
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,621
To begin with, you will take a long trip.

282
01:00:28,998 --> 01:00:31,163
I'll get the documents for you.

283
01:00:32,635 --> 01:00:34,903
You can choose a name.

284
01:00:35,805 --> 01:00:37,504
This will be fun.

285
01:00:38,108 --> 01:00:39,807
A new face,

286
01:00:40,543 --> 01:00:42,401
A new identity.

287
01:00:42,712 --> 01:00:46,072
You are more beautiful than you were.

288
01:00:46,783 --> 01:00:50,450
With an angelic air that you didn't have before.

289
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:55,853
Angelic... I don't know.

290
01:00:57,327 --> 01:01:01,296
In front of a mirror...

291
01:01:01,297 --> 01:01:03,155
It feels like I'm in front of someone who looks like me.

292
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:07,294
That comes from afar.

293
01:01:07,771 --> 01:01:09,629
Very far away

294
01:01:10,073 --> 01:01:11,772
E Jacques?

295
01:01:17,147 --> 01:01:21,178
Sure, this is a problem.

296
01:01:22,485 --> 01:01:24,844
I will explain to him.

297
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:28,780
He loves you very much.

298
01:01:31,094 --> 01:01:33,453
He will be very happy.

299
01:01:34,898 --> 01:01:36,096
He used to smile.

300
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,698
He used to smile.

301
01:01:40,103 --> 01:01:41,961
Not so much.

302
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:05,060
Give him Pentothal. I'll be right there.

303
01:02:08,531 --> 01:02:10,526
Another emergency.

304
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:16,070
Come with me. I'm sorry, darling.

305
01:02:38,361 --> 01:02:40,219
Don't wear makeup anymore.

306
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,158
Porqu�?

307
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,201
No reason.

308
01:02:49,939 --> 01:02:52,969
She's naturally beautiful, that's why.

309
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:57,311
See you tomorrow, dear.

310
01:03:03,419 --> 01:03:07,280
I won't be long, I'll be back to say goodnight.

311
01:03:18,101 --> 01:03:20,302
You look worried.

312
01:03:20,303 --> 01:03:23,970
Nothing, your imagination.

313
01:03:25,942 --> 01:03:27,709
Why are you lying?

314
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:31,502
After so long I can read your face

315
01:03:32,115 --> 01:03:33,848
Tell me the truth.

316
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,087
He is lost.

317
01:03:53,803 --> 01:03:55,661
February 15th.

318
01:03:56,606 --> 01:03:58,464
February 20th.

319
01:03:59,809 --> 01:04:04,671
A week after healing, small subcutaneous spots appear.

320
01:04:06,115 --> 01:04:12,149
Later, palpation reveals small subcutaneous nodules.

321
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:19,759
On the 12th day, necrosis of the transplanted tissue is clear.

322
01:04:21,297 --> 01:04:23,189
Vig�simo...

323
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:30,702
First ulcerations accompanied by skin detachment and infection.

324
01:04:31,341 --> 01:04:34,542
And the necrotic transplant needs to be removed.

325
01:05:09,479 --> 01:05:14,341
With an older dog, anything is possible.

326
01:05:16,886 --> 01:05:21,919
It is necessary to satisfy the pack.

327
01:06:16,112 --> 01:06:18,312
I'm listening.

328
01:06:20,316 --> 01:06:22,050
Home!

329
01:06:22,051 --> 01:06:23,909
This is annoying!

330
01:06:25,488 --> 01:06:26,686
Say something!

331
01:06:28,391 --> 01:06:30,056
Jacques...

332
01:06:41,304 --> 01:06:44,072
Are you crazy? Who did you call?

333
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,700
Ningu�m.

334
01:06:45,975 --> 01:06:48,607
Do you realize how reckless you were?

335
01:06:49,245 --> 01:06:52,147
I know, the dead must be silent.

336
01:06:52,148 --> 01:06:55,008
So I died to the good things.

337
01:06:55,518 --> 01:06:57,217
I can't take it anymore!

338
01:06:57,854 --> 01:07:00,281
I can no longer see myself.

339
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:03,190
I can't touch my face anymore.

340
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,896
I'm afraid of feeling grooves and cracks

341
01:07:07,897 --> 01:07:11,462
Pale as a tripe.

342
01:07:13,169 --> 01:07:16,972
Calm down, my dear. Have confidence.

343
01:07:16,973 --> 01:07:18,831
He'll succeed, I'm sure of it.

344
01:07:19,475 --> 01:07:22,177
That's a lie, he'll never succeed.

345
01:07:22,178 --> 01:07:25,038
He will continue to experiment on me as if I were one of his dogs.

346
01:07:25,348 --> 01:07:28,276
A human guinea pig, good for him!

347
01:07:28,751 --> 01:07:30,780
You have no right to say that.

348
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:34,450
I want to die, I beg you!

349
01:07:34,924 --> 01:07:39,957
Those shots he gives the dogs when he's finished. Mercy.

350
01:07:42,398 --> 01:07:43,926
Hold back!

351
01:07:44,367 --> 01:07:48,228
You have to kill me. I can't do it anymore!

352
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:58,608
Hello? Come quickly!

353
01:07:59,916 --> 01:08:02,651
I'm sure I heard Christiane's voice.

354
01:08:02,652 --> 01:08:06,353
You think you heard, especially on the phone.

355
01:08:06,756 --> 01:08:08,990
Did you tell Professor G�nessier about this?

356
01:08:08,991 --> 01:08:12,761
Of course. But he insisted that he recognized his daughter's body.

357
01:08:12,762 --> 01:08:14,893
I know, I was there.

358
01:08:15,364 --> 01:08:17,222
What can I tell you?

359
01:08:17,533 --> 01:08:20,199
It may have been a bad joke.

360
01:08:21,003 --> 01:08:22,504
He can...

361
01:08:22,505 --> 01:08:25,706
Doctor, I only work with accurate facts.

362
01:08:26,108 --> 01:08:28,810
Here I have the testimonies...

363
01:08:28,811 --> 01:08:32,512
'I think that', 'It seems to me that'...

364
01:08:32,982 --> 01:08:35,383
Vague things.

365
01:08:35,384 --> 01:08:37,586
"A red taxi arrived."

366
01:08:37,587 --> 01:08:41,389
"A beautiful woman with a pearl necklace."

367
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:43,681
"That accompanied the other."

368
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:47,255
A pearl dog collar?

369
01:08:49,765 --> 01:08:52,133
Does this remind you of anything?

370
01:08:52,134 --> 01:08:53,992
Wait.

371
01:08:55,471 --> 01:08:58,433
Yes, it reminds me of someone.

372
01:09:31,807 --> 01:09:34,632
You told me it was all over.

373
01:09:34,944 --> 01:09:38,543
I expected that, Miss Paulette M�rodon,

374
01:09:38,848 --> 01:09:41,616
But the case went its way and...

375
01:09:41,617 --> 01:09:43,646
They found me too lenient.

376
01:09:46,455 --> 01:09:49,815
If I understand correctly, I'm registered...

377
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:54,425
- � a pris�o. - N�o, o tribunal.

378
01:09:54,897 --> 01:09:56,926
O tribunal!

379
01:09:59,235 --> 01:10:02,003
From what I know of my parents, they won't like it.

380
01:10:03,472 --> 01:10:05,603
I thought of something.

381
01:10:06,075 --> 01:10:09,435
There would be a way to avoid all this.

382
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,442
But it would require a lot of discretion...

383
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:16,785
and some intelligence.

384
01:10:16,786 --> 01:10:20,487
I am very, very discreet, and also intelligent!

385
01:10:20,956 --> 01:10:22,691
Anyway, if it's not complicated...

386
01:10:22,692 --> 01:10:24,659
Voc� ver�

387
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:27,562
It will only be a small service that he will do for us.

388
01:10:27,563 --> 01:10:32,067
- What do I have to do? - Bleach my hair, for starters.

389
01:10:32,068 --> 01:10:35,929
- You're kidding. - That's not our standard.

390
01:10:36,572 --> 01:10:39,602
We need you to be blonder.

391
01:10:39,909 --> 01:10:42,310
- I don't know if I'll be okay. - It doesn't matter.

392
01:10:42,311 --> 01:10:46,715
You will go to a doctor and he will admit you.

393
01:10:46,716 --> 01:10:49,746
- I'm not sick! - He'll say he is.

394
01:10:50,386 --> 01:10:53,246
Fill her in on the details.

395
01:10:53,723 --> 01:10:56,958
At the clinic, you will complain of headaches.

396
01:10:56,959 --> 01:10:59,227
I'll write everything down for you.

397
01:10:59,695 --> 01:11:02,395
Falar� com Dr. Gleize.

398
01:11:06,035 --> 01:11:08,799
He will send a letter to Dr. G�nessier

399
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,905
Hello? Dr. Jaque Vernon?

400
01:11:10,906 --> 01:11:12,605
Yes, it's me.

401
01:11:16,912 --> 01:11:18,770
What did you say?

402
01:11:19,248 --> 01:11:21,277
Wait, I'll write it down.

403
01:11:28,624 --> 01:11:31,484
I think she will be able to come in tomorrow morning.

404
01:11:33,262 --> 01:11:36,164
Rest assured, I won't lose sight of you.

405
01:11:36,165 --> 01:11:39,366
Just for a hypothesis.

406
01:11:42,004 --> 01:11:46,206
If something happens, I'll let you know immediately.

407
01:12:04,527 --> 01:12:06,094
Are you behaving well?

408
01:12:06,095 --> 01:12:07,953
Very good, doctor.

409
01:12:15,604 --> 01:12:18,173
Miss arrived this morning.

410
01:12:18,174 --> 01:12:20,533
- Who is treating her? - Dr. Gleize.

411
01:12:21,343 --> 01:12:23,201
See the letter.

412
01:12:29,385 --> 01:12:31,243
Are you experiencing a lot of pain?

413
01:12:32,721 --> 01:12:34,289
Try.

414
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:36,922
Well, sometimes...

415
01:12:39,562 --> 01:12:45,095
We will perform a fundus examination and an electroencephalogram.

416
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,100
Doctor

417
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:49,799
Are they going to shave my head?

418
01:12:50,107 --> 01:12:53,675
I hope not.

419
01:12:53,676 --> 01:12:55,705
It would be a shame.

420
01:13:03,052 --> 01:13:08,119
An Electro... encephalogram...

421
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:27,566
Don't be afraid.

422
01:13:28,043 --> 01:13:30,243
We are not friends.

423
01:13:30,713 --> 01:13:32,981
Don't touch your face.

424
01:13:35,885 --> 01:13:38,415
Tell me how many fingers are there?

425
01:13:53,168 --> 01:13:54,799
Tr�s.

426
01:13:58,774 --> 01:14:01,634
And now, how many?

427
01:14:03,612 --> 01:14:04,970
Tr�s

428
01:14:06,549 --> 01:14:09,340
No, two.

429
01:14:39,949 --> 01:14:42,684
So doctor, what do you think?

430
01:14:42,685 --> 01:14:44,543
I am hopeful.

431
01:14:46,689 --> 01:14:48,923
Tell me, Doctor.

432
01:14:49,925 --> 01:14:51,326
Did you save him?

433
01:14:51,327 --> 01:14:53,185
Certainly.

434
01:14:53,996 --> 01:14:55,854
Have confidence. Let's go!

435
01:15:01,637 --> 01:15:03,638
What is your prognosis?

436
01:15:03,639 --> 01:15:05,497
And you?

437
01:15:06,241 --> 01:15:08,099
We agree.

438
01:15:14,817 --> 01:15:16,675
Close your eyes.

439
01:15:18,587 --> 01:15:20,650
Open your eyes.

440
01:15:33,335 --> 01:15:36,035
It's over, open your eyes.

441
01:15:39,842 --> 01:15:43,543
We will do an electrical stimulation, it won't hurt.

442
01:15:44,847 --> 01:15:46,705
N�o mexa a cabe�a.

443
01:15:58,027 --> 01:15:59,385
Close.

444
01:16:03,365 --> 01:16:05,064
Continue.

445
01:16:08,871 --> 01:16:10,729
Open your eyes.

446
01:16:11,507 --> 01:16:13,365
Close.

447
01:16:36,732 --> 01:16:39,796
Bring me the exam when you're done.

448
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:55,111
Nothing suspicious about Paulette Mordon.

449
01:17:09,331 --> 01:17:12,191
Sir, 15 is hemorrhaging.

450
01:17:12,668 --> 01:17:14,993
Take care of this case, Jacques.

451
01:17:56,311 --> 01:17:58,340
Here is the exam, sir.

452
01:18:02,818 --> 01:18:05,848
No changes, everything is fine.

453
01:18:06,488 --> 01:18:08,723
Release her tonight,

454
01:18:08,724 --> 01:18:10,924
thus freeing up the bed.

455
01:18:11,393 --> 01:18:14,423
We may have an emergency at night.

456
01:18:37,186 --> 01:18:40,755
- Should I hand this to you? - Yes, thank you.

457
01:18:40,756 --> 01:18:43,786
- Can I call? - Yes, to Paris?

458
01:18:44,259 --> 01:18:47,585
- What is the number? - Botzaris 4844.

459
01:18:58,373 --> 01:19:00,942
M�e? � Paulette.

460
01:19:00,943 --> 01:19:03,511
Everything is fine. I'm going.

461
01:19:03,512 --> 01:19:05,279
At� logo.

462
01:19:05,914 --> 01:19:08,182
- How much do I owe? - Nothing.

463
01:19:08,483 --> 01:19:10,952
How do I get back to Paris?

464
01:19:10,953 --> 01:19:15,485
By bus, exit on the left, about 15 minutes.

465
01:19:42,618 --> 01:19:47,021
I can take you, miss, I'll go in your direction.

466
01:19:47,022 --> 01:19:48,880
With pleasure, madam.

467
01:20:02,771 --> 01:20:04,629
Inspector Parot?

468
01:20:05,107 --> 01:20:07,375
� Jacques Vernon.

469
01:20:09,177 --> 01:20:10,910
As a Doctor?

470
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,481
Has she left yet?

471
01:20:13,482 --> 01:20:16,012
He did not linger in his clinic.

472
01:20:16,752 --> 01:20:19,282
It cannot be said that they were kidnapped.

473
01:20:21,957 --> 01:20:23,986
And what did you say?

474
01:20:24,293 --> 01:20:27,494
Let's make sure she comes back okay.

475
01:20:27,629 --> 01:20:30,159
Thank you for letting us know, doctor.

476
01:20:47,649 --> 01:20:50,184
Two gentlemen are looking for you.

477
01:20:50,185 --> 01:20:52,350
But I don't have time.

478
01:20:52,988 --> 01:20:54,846
Tell them to come back tomorrow.

479
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,848
We feel uncomfortable at this hour.

480
01:22:27,849 --> 01:22:33,052
We would like to know if Miss M�rodon left the clinic this evening.

481
01:22:34,523 --> 01:22:36,848
How did they know she left?

482
01:22:37,159 --> 01:22:40,961
He called his mother to let her know he was coming back.

483
01:22:40,962 --> 01:22:44,365
And she didn't come home.

484
01:22:44,366 --> 01:22:46,896
So we came here to check.

485
01:22:48,203 --> 01:22:50,562
Checking this is easy.

486
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:54,399
I gave the order to release this patient.

487
01:22:55,877 --> 01:23:00,409
- Paulette M�rodon left? - I'll see you, sir.

488
01:23:03,218 --> 01:23:06,919
So, are you interested in this young woman?

489
01:23:07,956 --> 01:23:11,987
She is involved in a very complicated case.

490
01:23:12,461 --> 01:23:14,956
We wanted to see you tonight.

491
01:23:16,098 --> 01:23:19,567
I would say they arrived late.

492
01:23:19,568 --> 01:23:22,268
Paulette M�rodon. Here it is.

493
01:23:22,904 --> 01:23:28,175
Now I remember, a girl with light eyes, she made a call from here.

494
01:23:28,176 --> 01:23:30,876
I told her she could take the bus.

495
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:34,038
Did you see?

496
01:23:34,516 --> 01:23:36,374
I am really sorry,

497
01:23:37,018 --> 01:23:38,986
But after they pass through the door,

498
01:23:38,987 --> 01:23:41,619
The patients are no longer my responsibility.

499
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:44,654
Yes, of course, I understand.

500
01:23:45,127 --> 01:23:48,453
Once again, sorry for the inconvenience.

501
01:23:49,097 --> 01:23:51,297
Not for that reason.

502
01:23:59,741 --> 01:24:02,566
- Good evening, Professor. - Good evening.

503
01:24:03,912 --> 01:24:08,615
Jacques, you are leaving, please accompany the gentlemen.

504
01:24:35,544 --> 01:24:37,845
I apologize for the pointless work.

505
01:24:37,846 --> 01:24:39,704
No problem, doctor, we are

506
01:24:40,415 --> 01:24:43,309
accustomed to false leads.

507
01:24:44,452 --> 01:24:48,210
I put myself in your shoes, I'm starting to get ideas.

508
01:24:49,691 --> 01:24:52,393
Yes, so many coincidences.

509
01:24:52,394 --> 01:24:54,528
It would be best to get your head straight.

510
01:24:54,529 --> 01:24:57,229
After this, it's even better.

511
01:24:57,866 --> 01:25:00,000
And speaking of the heart,

512
01:25:00,001 --> 01:25:05,034
I'm sure everything will work out on this side.

513
01:25:05,674 --> 01:25:08,075
You are young, Doctor.

514
01:25:08,076 --> 01:25:10,539
You have your whole life ahead of you.

515
01:26:28,456 --> 01:26:30,314
Drop it!

516
01:26:41,503 --> 01:26:43,202
Why this?
