1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,709
Through the Looking Glass

2
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:11,900
after the eponymous tale by L. Carroll

3
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:13,309
Part Three

4
00:00:13,992 --> 00:00:15,208
To the House of Tweedledum
To the House of Tweedledee

5
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,567
The arrows, for some reason,
both pointed the same way.

6
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:25,270
"I do believe," thought Alice, "that
Tweedledum and Tweedledee live together!"

7
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:29,119
I'll just visit and say "how d'you do?"
and ask them the way out of the wood.

8
00:00:39,463 --> 00:00:45,902
If you think we're wax-works, you ought
to pay, you know. They are pay-per-view.

9
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:49,766
Contrariwise, you ought to do otherwise.

10
00:00:50,048 --> 00:01:00,056
- I'm very sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
- The first thing in a visit is to say
"How d'ye do?" and shake hands!

11
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:18,143
Tweedledum and Tweedledee
Agreed to have a battle
For Tweedledum said Tweedledee
Had spoiled his nice new rattle.

12
00:01:18,686 --> 00:01:26,280
So nice it was... so new it was...
Had spoiled his nice new rattle.

13
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:41,623
Just then flew down a monstrous crow,
As black as a tar-barrel;
Which frightened both the heroes so,
They quite forgot their quarrel.

14
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:55,913
Tra-la (ra-la-la!), tru-lu (ru-lu-lu!)
...they quite forgot... their quarrel!

15
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:08,031
Do you see <i>that</i>?

16
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:16,511
- I knew it! It's spoilt!
- You needn't be so angry about an old rattle.

17
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:24,435
But it isn’t old! It's new, I tell you.
My nice new RATTLE!

18
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:35,380
- Of course you agree to have a battle?
- I suppose so! Only <i>she</i> must
help us to dress up.

19
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:50,164
Fasten it tighter, or my head could get cut off.
You know, the loss of one's head
is a very serious loss.

20
00:02:52,444 --> 00:03:00,370
I'm very brave generally, only to-day
I happen to have a headache.
Do I look very pale?

21
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:06,931
And <i>I’ve</i> got a toothache!
I'm far worse off than you!
- Then you’d better not fight to-day.

22
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:16,596
- We must have a bit of a fight!
- Let's fight till six, and then have dinner.

23
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:25,932
- What a thick black cloud that is!
Why, I do believe it’s got wings!
It's the crow!

24
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:39,172
Oh, that's the White Queen!

25
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:49,956
Would you like to be my lady's maid?
Twopence a week and jam every other day.

26
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:56,251
- No, thank you - and I don't want any jam today.
- You won't receive it today.

27
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:59,332
Jam every <i>other</i> day.

28
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:04,675
That's dreadfully confusing,
I don't understand you at all.

29
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:10,899
- It's just that you are not used
to the effect of living backwards.
- Living backwards?

30
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:31,420
- My finger's bleeding! Bleeding!
- Have you pricked your finger?

31
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:42,916
Not <i>yet</i>, but it hurts already. And
now I shall prick it. That accounts for the
bleeding, you see. Now do you understand
the way things happen here?

32
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:51,732
- Then your finger no longer hurts?
- No!... It does not. Thank you,
tha-a... baa-a-a-a....

33
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:15,324
What is it you want to buy?

34
00:05:16,603 --> 00:05:23,762
- I should like to buy an egg, please.
How do you sell them?
- One for ten kopek, two for five-kopek and a half.

35
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:27,364
Then two eggs are cheaper than one?

36
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:38,028
Then I'll have <i>one</i>, please,
- I never put things into people's hands
—if you ne-e-ed it, ge-e-et it for yourself!

37
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:44,307
"But that's Humpty Dumpty!" Alice thought.
"That's him and nobody else!"

38
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:50,340
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall:
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

39
00:05:51,708 --> 00:06:02,227
All the King's horses and all the King's men
Couldn't put Humpty... couldn't put Dumpty...
Humpty Dumpty, Dumpty Humpty,
Humpty Dumpty in his place again.

40
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:11,828
- How exactly like an egg he is!
- I am so fed up with this!
Everybody calls me an egg. Every and all!

41
00:06:12,244 --> 00:06:16,627
Wouldn't you be more at ease down on
the ground? That wall is awfully narrow!

42
00:06:17,164 --> 00:06:22,900
Not at all! But if ever I <i>did</i>
fall off, the King has promised me —
with his very own mouth — to...

43
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:31,133
- To send all his horses and all his men.
- You were eavesdropping, weren't you?

44
00:06:32,027 --> 00:06:39,621
- No, I read it in a book!
Would you kindly tell me the meaning
of the poem called "Jabberwocky"?

45
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:46,788
I can explain all the poems that were
ever invented — and a good many that haven't
been invented just yet. Let's hear it!

46
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:53,772
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

47
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:58,284
That's enough to begin with. Well, then:

48
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:06,572
"Brillig" means eight o'clock in the
evening when it's time for supper.
- I understand. And "slithy"?

49
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:16,715
That's lithe and slimy. That word is like
a portmanteau - you open it and find two
compartments! Two meanings packed up into one word.

50
00:07:17,683 --> 00:07:23,684
- Ah, I see it now... and what are "toves"?
- They're a mixture of ferrets, badgers and corkscrews.

51
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:29,980
- They must be very curious looking creatures!
- They are that.
- And what's the "gyre" and to "gimble"?

52
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:37,595
- To go round like a gyroscope,
to make holes like a gimlet!
- And what is "the Wabe"?
- Farewell.

53
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:46,892
- Never in my life have I met someone so
repulsive... so rip-rap-ryp-repulsive.

54
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:03,068
My dear, did you happen to meet anybody?
I've sent all my horses and all my men!

55
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:10,347
- There are thousands of them there!
- The exact number is 4207 people.

56
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:12,339
I am expecting a Messenger any minute now.

57
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,268
Just look along the road,
who do you see there?

58
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:24,212
- Nobody.
- I only wish <i>I</i> had such eyes!
To see Nobody, and at that distance, too!

59
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:35,228
Who did you pass on the road?
- Nobody.

60
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:43,647
This young lady saw him too.
What's happened in the town?
- I'd better wh... whisper it in your ear.

61
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:44,892
- Go on.

62
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:51,323
- They’re at it again!
- Do you call <i>that</i> a whisper?!
If you should ever

63
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:57,251
scream like that again,
I'll have you buttered!
- Who are at it again?

64
00:08:57,748 --> 00:09:10,332
Why, the Lion and the Unicorn, of course.
Fighting to the death for the crown. For <i>my</i>
crown, by the way. Let's run and see them!

65
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:27,267
I hear you saying: "like fairy-tale living"
But judge for yourselves: is that easily lived?

66
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:38,044
You can't do a thing here without being cautious,
Because of uncertainly and of obscurity,
And lack of knowledge and unpleasantness...

67
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:44,571
Oh, it's so complicated!
And that's where the fun is!
You can't take one step here without taking care.

68
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:54,732
Although, on the bright side,
In fairy tales we meet
With real, living queens,
Sometimes even a king.

69
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:59,844
And have a nice chat with
The real Humpty Dumpty,

70
00:10:02,012 --> 00:10:05,560
And we sing songs with,
And we sing songs with
Tweedledum, Tweedledee.
