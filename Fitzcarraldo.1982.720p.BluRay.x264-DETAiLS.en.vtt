WEBVTT

00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.750
Hurry up, we're already late!

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.708
The important thing is to arrive with elegance.

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:13.131
A few minutes more or less...

00:02:13.215 --> 00:02:18.044
We'll lose track of Caruso if we don't hurry.

00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:25.729
You got your face dirty, come here.

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.941
- Oh, Molly, please. - Isn't this better?

00:02:30.028 --> 00:02:32.104
Come, for God's sake.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.701
Fitz!

00:02:45.297 --> 00:02:47.170
The finest champagne for horses.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.467
We'll make it!

00:05:47.432 --> 00:05:49.639
Madam, sir, you cannot enter.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.604
It's a gala performance.

00:05:51.687 --> 00:05:55.816
We came from Iquitos, 2,000 km away along the Amazon.

00:05:56.693 --> 00:05:58.486
The engine broke down and I had to row.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:59.946
Look at your hands.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.275
Two days and two nights rowing to see Caruso once in a lifetime.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.528
- Please... - I'm sorry, you don't have tickets.

00:06:06.622 --> 00:06:11.914
We need to get in at any cost. We don't have entry, but we have the right.

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.501
They cannot enter.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.901
I will build an opera house in Iquitos.

00:06:15.902 --> 00:06:17.212
And Caruso will inaugurate it.

00:06:17.468 --> 00:06:20.043
It will be the largest opera house the jungle has ever seen.

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:21.633
Let us in!

00:06:21.724 --> 00:06:25.557
He will work with us. Please let us in.

00:06:26.438 --> 00:06:27.470
I beg you!

00:06:30.818 --> 00:06:33.773
I myself would like to be in there.

00:06:49.257 --> 00:06:53.207
Remain silent and stand by the wall.

00:07:32.768 --> 00:07:35.639
He pointed at me. "Yes, of course."

00:07:38.566 --> 00:07:41.318
- Did you see it for me? - Yes.

00:07:41.945 --> 00:07:43.274
He pointed at me.

00:10:22.848 --> 00:10:24.841
Fitzcarrald?

00:10:25.226 --> 00:10:27.265
How do you spell that?

00:10:27.979 --> 00:10:30.352
What a strange name!

00:10:31.984 --> 00:10:35.104
My father was Irish. My real name is Fitzgerald.

00:10:35.446 --> 00:10:37.154
- Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald.

00:10:37.155 --> 00:10:38.862
The Peruvians couldn't pronounce it.

00:10:39.033 --> 00:10:42.320
Fitzgerald? From Iquitos?

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.868
It won't be the one about the railroad, will it?

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.493
Yes, it's me.

00:10:48.045 --> 00:10:53.005
Well, yes...

00:10:54.135 --> 00:10:56.592
The one on the trans-Andean railway, but...

00:10:58.015 --> 00:10:59.972
You probably already know that my project failed.

00:11:00.185 --> 00:11:03.470
But it was an excellent idea, and it still is.

00:11:03.688 --> 00:11:07.390
Now I'm trying my luck as an ice maker.

00:11:08.528 --> 00:11:14.947
Here, what the rich want is to see European celebrities.

00:11:17.122 --> 00:11:21.998
Sarah Bernhardt, an actress who can't even sing.

00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:25.748
But his wooden leg is the talk of the town.

00:11:26.425 --> 00:11:28.168
The ice...

00:11:29.052 --> 00:11:31.675
Well, I mean, I'm doing all of this...

00:11:32.307 --> 00:11:34.514
Because I have a dream...

00:11:35.686 --> 00:11:36.967
The opera.

00:11:38.314 --> 00:11:40.224
The great opera of the jungle.

00:11:41.192 --> 00:11:45.321
Fitzcarraldo will build it, and Caruso will sing at its premiere.

00:11:45.614 --> 00:11:48.485
Only dreamers move mountains.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.380
For the past 5 years, our city has been the richest in the world.

00:11:58.672 --> 00:12:00.914
It's like gold fever.

00:12:01.424 --> 00:12:03.502
Please...

00:12:07.057 --> 00:12:12.764
Soon this theater will be too small.

00:12:13.314 --> 00:12:16.732
Prices are ten times higher than in New York.

00:12:16.985 --> 00:12:21.280
Palaces are being built using Dutch ceramics...

00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:23.442
and Florentine marble.

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:25.695
Soon Iquitos will be like this.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.824
It's still a border town...

00:12:27.916 --> 00:12:31.535
But the rubber business is growing by leaps and bounds.

00:12:31.628 --> 00:12:35.709
The richest people in Manaus, if you'll allow me the expression...

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.086
They send their laundry to be done in Lisbon...

00:12:39.179 --> 00:12:43.592
Because they say the water in the Amazon is impure.

00:14:55.051 --> 00:14:56.083
Between.

00:14:56.177 --> 00:14:58.170
We're home again now.

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:03.802
Did you miss me?

00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:09.435
You're not going in?

00:15:10.194 --> 00:15:16.863
I don't know. I don't really like this.

00:15:17.077 --> 00:15:20.198
Oh, it's not that big of a deal.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.863
I teach girls how to run a household.

00:15:22.918 --> 00:15:25.326
This is better than if they were on the street.

00:15:27.048 --> 00:15:29.290
I have nothing against them.

00:15:29.385 --> 00:15:30.547
But I can't stand it...

00:15:30.635 --> 00:15:33.839
The upper class who believe that with money they can buy everything.

00:15:33.931 --> 00:15:35.212
And what about opera...?

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:38.304
I have to work in ice production.

00:15:38.562 --> 00:15:42.727
It could prove its respectability. That wouldn't be bad.

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:46.063
That's precisely why I ruined myself.

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:54.486
I prefer going to the suburbs. There I'm in my element.

00:15:54.915 --> 00:15:57.869
- The boys? - Yes, they're my audience.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.075
And a pig.

00:16:00.588 --> 00:16:05.167
There's a slow-witted pig who loves me.

00:16:05.427 --> 00:16:07.172
How could I not do it?

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:34.604
When I build my opera house, it will have its own box and a velvet armchair.

00:19:24.293 --> 00:19:27.378
It is the result of the chemical reaction of two salts.

00:19:27.463 --> 00:19:31.331
Ice has many uses, but people don't realize it.

00:19:31.426 --> 00:19:33.218
The children love it.

00:19:33.303 --> 00:19:34.679
Yes, they eat it.

00:19:37.433 --> 00:19:38.809
You're welcome?

00:19:38.893 --> 00:19:41.978
Someday there will be ice on all ships and in warehouses.

00:20:19.233 --> 00:20:20.859
Yes, your bets.

00:20:22.196 --> 00:20:25.945
- So, what do you think? - I'll tell you what I think.

00:20:26.034 --> 00:20:29.783
First, you won't be able to get a patent because the process is self-explanatory...

00:20:29.872 --> 00:20:32.743
It has been in school textbooks for over a hundred years.

00:20:33.334 --> 00:20:36.786
I know, but I have experience. And that's what counts.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.752
Second, what is the purpose of the ice here?

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:41.710
To cool the rubber?

00:20:41.845 --> 00:20:45.630
How to make coolers in the jungle, as if by magic?

00:20:47.435 --> 00:20:51.432
Or to put sleds on the trains of the Trans-Andean Railway...

00:20:51.523 --> 00:20:57.278
Release the brakes, push, and goodbye to the train, down the valley?

00:21:00.867 --> 00:21:03.323
Let's go!

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:09.741
Don't take it the wrong way!

00:21:10.128 --> 00:21:12.455
Come on, play with us.

00:21:13.633 --> 00:21:17.584
There's nothing like losing money.

00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:21.760
There's nothing like it. Pure ecstasy!

00:22:19.545 --> 00:22:24.967
This church will remain closed until the city has its opera house.

00:22:29.016 --> 00:22:31.341
I want the opera house.

00:22:32.019 --> 00:22:33.762
I want my opera house!

00:22:35.397 --> 00:22:37.724
I want the opera house!

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:44.482
This church will remain closed until the city has its opera house!

00:22:45.577 --> 00:22:48.614
I want my opera house!

00:22:49.331 --> 00:22:51.954
I want my opera house!

00:22:52.335 --> 00:22:54.376
I want my opera house!

00:23:12.902 --> 00:23:14.730
Come on, come on. Come on, get out of here.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.442
Come on... all at once. Now!

00:23:17.991 --> 00:23:21.326
Now... now... to the tower...

00:23:21.412 --> 00:23:23.321
running... he's crazy...

00:24:14.434 --> 00:24:21.518
He could be locked up for two weeks.

00:24:22.777 --> 00:24:25.863
Thank you, two days was enough.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.409
Of course, my wife Molly intervened.

00:24:32.498 --> 00:24:36.247
You're mistaken. But follow me.

00:24:36.336 --> 00:24:39.706
I'll show you why I let you leave so quickly.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.954
Come.

00:24:48.476 --> 00:24:51.726
- So? - ​​They've been there for two days, day and night.

00:24:51.813 --> 00:24:54.304
Even a horse would be moved.

00:24:59.863 --> 00:25:02.438
This won't be difficult to organize.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.534
Gather them all at once?

00:25:07.665 --> 00:25:10.037
Dom Aquilino, the Borja brothers, and the others?

00:25:10.084 --> 00:25:12.410
I have my resources, don't worry.

00:25:12.504 --> 00:25:14.627
I'll bring all my girls.

00:25:14.716 --> 00:25:18.049
All the rubber barons will come like flies...

00:25:18.136 --> 00:25:20.628
And I will make sure they feel good.

00:25:20.765 --> 00:25:23.600
Great, I'll bring my gramophone.

00:25:23.934 --> 00:25:29.143
First, you need to dress better. I won't let you go like that.

00:25:29.232 --> 00:25:33.148
A bath for Mr. Fitzcarraldo, the full service.

00:25:33.238 --> 00:25:35.444
And then take him to my room.

00:25:37.075 --> 00:25:38.653
What are they doing?

00:25:38.744 --> 00:25:42.576
Help! Molly, tell them to stop!

00:25:50.341 --> 00:25:55.550
Everyone wants to take money from me: The hospital, the fire department...

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.345
And now you fill my ears with your opera.

00:25:58.435 --> 00:26:01.306
This would express our best feelings.

00:26:02.439 --> 00:26:05.394
Our best wishes!

00:26:05.486 --> 00:26:07.312
We can't have everything.

00:26:08.822 --> 00:26:10.731
Take note of this.

00:26:11.451 --> 00:26:13.775
Come closer.

00:26:13.869 --> 00:26:16.409
Come a little closer.

00:26:20.461 --> 00:26:22.750
A small demonstration.

00:26:25.926 --> 00:26:29.261
A thousand dollars will prove better.

00:26:33.894 --> 00:26:37.180
Did you see how quickly the money disappears?

00:26:37.274 --> 00:26:39.516
You must have experienced this.

00:26:39.609 --> 00:26:42.695
Of course, a lot of money had to be invested in the railroad.

00:26:44.115 --> 00:26:47.532
How exciting it must have been to be ruined!

00:26:47.619 --> 00:26:49.907
Let's return to our friends.

00:26:49.997 --> 00:26:54.707
Yes, the opportunity to see friends and rivals in the same place...

00:26:54.752 --> 00:26:56.829
It doesn't appear very often.

00:27:24.997 --> 00:27:26.077
Rosita, over here.

00:27:26.207 --> 00:27:27.999
And you bring the champagne.

00:27:34.593 --> 00:27:37.843
Please pay attention.

00:27:37.888 --> 00:27:40.509
Please come closer.

00:28:31.328 --> 00:28:32.702
Get him out of here!

00:28:32.788 --> 00:28:34.946
- What? - Get him out of here!

00:28:37.502 --> 00:28:41.880
Please, please. One moment, please.

00:28:42.298 --> 00:28:45.799
Ladies and gentlemen, don't worry.

00:28:46.095 --> 00:28:52.385
This man is harmless, he just had a trance.

00:28:52.477 --> 00:28:57.225
Sir, my servants will escort you to the kitchen.

00:28:57.318 --> 00:29:00.234
My dogs' cook will prepare your dinner.

00:29:00.695 --> 00:29:05.489
Thank you so much, it was amazing.

00:29:08.205 --> 00:29:10.032
By the cook of his dogs.

00:29:14.087 --> 00:29:15.416
By Verdi.

00:29:17.883 --> 00:29:19.128
By Rossini.

00:29:21.847 --> 00:29:23.175
By Caruso.

00:29:23.266 --> 00:29:26.599
By Fitzcarraldo, the conqueror of the useless.

00:29:26.686 --> 00:29:28.181
Your health!

00:29:32.693 --> 00:29:35.563
As sure as I am, I'm here...

00:29:35.738 --> 00:29:38.491
Someday I will bring the Grand Opera to Iquitos.

00:29:39.201 --> 00:29:42.119
So, I'm going to surpass them...

00:29:43.748 --> 00:29:45.788
humble them…

00:29:45.875 --> 00:29:48.034
I am the spectacle of the forest...

00:29:48.338 --> 00:29:50.246
I am the inventor of rubber...

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.629
I'm going to delete them.

00:29:52.717 --> 00:29:56.845
Sir, the reality of your world...

00:29:56.931 --> 00:30:02.721
It's nothing more than a caricature of grand opera.

00:30:02.813 --> 00:30:05.767
Fitz, let's go.

00:30:06.025 --> 00:30:09.276
This man is no longer your opponent; he's already dead.

00:30:09.362 --> 00:30:13.313
Madam, I stand firmly on my own two feet.

00:30:13.409 --> 00:30:15.781
He's a great hunter, isn't he?

00:30:15.996 --> 00:30:18.367
What does this have to do with anything?

00:30:18.457 --> 00:30:19.785
You should have known.

00:30:19.875 --> 00:30:22.105
When we shoot an elephant,

00:30:22.106 --> 00:30:24.336
Sometimes he can stand for ten days...

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:25.881
before it collapses.

00:30:26.049 --> 00:30:27.081
Goodnight.

00:30:27.259 --> 00:30:32.088
Come on, Zulma, let's go. This way, let's go.

00:30:46.115 --> 00:30:47.906
Rubber is the only option.

00:30:47.993 --> 00:30:50.911
That's where the money is. Forget about the ice.

00:30:51.871 --> 00:30:55.740
A large ship is needed...

00:30:56.002 --> 00:30:57.627
hundreds of workers...

00:30:57.671 --> 00:30:59.413
But above all, land.

00:30:59.506 --> 00:31:02.710
There must still be something left. They didn't divide it all.

00:31:02.802 --> 00:31:04.462
Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.

00:31:04.554 --> 00:31:06.096
How do you know?

00:31:06.182 --> 00:31:09.633
Dom Aquilino was talking about this.

00:31:09.726 --> 00:31:10.972
Then forget about it.

00:31:12.063 --> 00:31:14.305
Why don't you talk to him?

00:31:26.038 --> 00:31:29.871
My property begins here where Pongo ends...

00:31:31.586 --> 00:31:35.964
and extends 130 km upstream.

00:31:36.467 --> 00:31:38.127
And what about Pongo?

00:31:38.344 --> 00:31:40.836
I wish it were mine too.

00:31:41.015 --> 00:31:44.763
We are thinking of opening a path through these mountains.

00:31:44.853 --> 00:31:47.522
But that would be an impossible task...

00:31:48.107 --> 00:31:49.815
And even then there wouldn't be...

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:50.932
A ship...?

00:31:52.028 --> 00:31:54.187
And nobody managed to go upstream?

00:31:57.659 --> 00:31:59.487
Do you want to see it for yourself?

00:31:59.829 --> 00:32:02.285
We can continue on foot, if you wish.

00:32:08.965 --> 00:32:10.293
What does it say?

00:32:10.842 --> 00:32:13.001
That we should remain silent.

00:32:13.095 --> 00:32:17.557
Whoever speaks will be swallowed by the evil spirits of the whirlwind.

00:32:53.393 --> 00:32:57.012
The Indians call whirlpools Chirimagua...

00:32:57.148 --> 00:32:59.188
"the choleric spirits".

00:32:59.859 --> 00:33:03.111
Whoever falls there is lost.

00:33:03.488 --> 00:33:05.898
They also say that...

00:33:05.992 --> 00:33:09.492
"Water has no hair to cling to."

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:39.191
Is this a rubber tree?

00:33:41.702 --> 00:33:44.953
Yes. Brazilian rubber tree.

00:33:57.888 --> 00:34:03.049
They call it cauchuch, the weeping tree.

00:34:03.394 --> 00:34:06.229
These indigenous people love the flowery language.

00:34:06.523 --> 00:34:11.566
They call gold the sweat of the sun, and bees the mothers of honey.

00:34:14.074 --> 00:34:18.489
It's not easy to civilize them, I assure you.

00:34:33.431 --> 00:34:36.717
How much do you think that weighs?

00:34:38.687 --> 00:34:40.312
60 kilos!

00:34:41.107 --> 00:34:44.061
I assume you are familiar with market prices.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.353
How long does it take to make one of these?

00:34:46.446 --> 00:34:48.523
Three men, one week.

00:34:57.502 --> 00:35:00.871
I currently have 8,500 people working for me...

00:35:04.552 --> 00:35:08.799
But I want to reach 10,000.

00:35:12.394 --> 00:35:17.272
You're a strange guy, but I have to admit I like you.

00:35:57.574 --> 00:36:02.700
Look: my area extends from Pongo to the mouth of the Ucayali River.

00:36:02.789 --> 00:36:05.992
Above is the Amazon Company of Peru...

00:36:06.084 --> 00:36:07.709
a public limited company.

00:36:07.794 --> 00:36:09.953
And there are the Borja brothers...

00:36:10.048 --> 00:36:11.957
What does this square mean?

00:36:12.008 --> 00:36:14.380
It's the rubber zone of the Ucayali...

00:36:14.677 --> 00:36:17.169
with 14 million trees.

00:36:17.891 --> 00:36:20.298
It's the only area without an owner.

00:36:20.392 --> 00:36:22.967
due to the whirlpools of Pongo das Mortes...

00:36:23.063 --> 00:36:26.599
You would need wings to enter this area.

00:36:26.859 --> 00:36:29.612
Why is there nothing marked on Pachitea?

00:36:29.779 --> 00:36:32.532
There are no rubber trees there.

00:36:32.616 --> 00:36:36.282
There might be some, but not enough to make it profitable.

00:36:36.371 --> 00:36:39.372
The only thing you'll find there are headhunters.

00:36:39.457 --> 00:36:45.294
There is no rubber, no gold, nothing.

00:36:49.136 --> 00:36:51.213
The two rivers almost meet.

00:36:51.306 --> 00:36:52.385
As?

00:36:54.851 --> 00:36:59.894
Is this map accurate? Is there a more detailed one?

00:37:00.233 --> 00:37:02.724
It's a pretty good map.

00:37:03.862 --> 00:37:09.284
In 1896, a group of surveyors and soldiers arrived at Alto Pachitea.

00:37:09.369 --> 00:37:11.197
But they killed almost all of them.

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:16.788
Later, some missionaries arrived in Saramiriza, their most remote parish.

00:37:17.129 --> 00:37:21.837
From there you will only find wild Jivara and Campa people.

00:37:24.053 --> 00:37:26.723
Two priests ended up with their heads shrunk.

00:37:26.807 --> 00:37:29.298
Have you ever seen a shrunken head?

00:37:29.518 --> 00:37:30.681
Try...

00:37:31.646 --> 00:37:32.844
To mean...

00:37:33.856 --> 00:37:36.692
No... Somewhat similar.

00:37:57.343 --> 00:37:58.672
Have you made your choice yet?

00:37:58.762 --> 00:38:02.261
I can't decide, I think I'll keep both.

00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:03.760
Molly!

00:38:04.351 --> 00:38:06.119
- What it was?

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.888
I need your money... every penny.

00:38:07.982 --> 00:38:10.307
- Oh, Fitz, not again. - I've got an idea.

00:38:11.986 --> 00:38:13.777
A fantastic idea.

00:38:15.072 --> 00:38:19.487
Look, I brought some maps.

00:38:19.745 --> 00:38:22.201
I can explain all of that.

00:38:37.476 --> 00:38:41.937
First I have to speak to a notary and then get a ship.

00:38:42.021 --> 00:38:44.561
My money won't be enough for a boat.

00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:46.193
Don't worry.

00:39:20.527 --> 00:39:23.647
- The documents, please. - Thank you.

00:39:27.994 --> 00:39:30.402
The acquisition of the area has to follow certain steps.

00:39:30.497 --> 00:39:34.081
First, you and your partner sign, then they hand over the money...

00:39:34.168 --> 00:39:36.873
And I legalize it with my signature.

00:39:37.381 --> 00:39:41.676
But first, I want you to understand the option clause.

00:39:41.803 --> 00:39:43.630
Which option clause?

00:39:44.848 --> 00:39:49.807
Through its executive bodies, the Peruvian government demands that...

00:39:49.937 --> 00:39:53.473
the acquisition of a territory of this size...

00:39:53.567 --> 00:39:58.479
It must be done by means of a deed and for a trial period of nine months.

00:39:58.572 --> 00:40:04.826
You must demonstrate that you are doing everything necessary to explore the region.

00:40:04.914 --> 00:40:08.865
Otherwise, they will lose the right to exploit the land.

00:40:09.001 --> 00:40:13.582
The state has an interest in areas like this being productive...

00:40:13.674 --> 00:40:16.166
in the hands of competent people...

00:40:16.261 --> 00:40:17.589
as the State is.

00:40:17.722 --> 00:40:20.093
Come on, we're wasting time.

00:40:20.474 --> 00:40:23.844
May I ask a personal question?

00:40:25.188 --> 00:40:28.059
Do you really know what you're doing?

00:40:29.526 --> 00:40:31.686
We're going to do what no one has done before.

00:40:31.779 --> 00:40:34.817
We will become very, very rich.

00:40:37.912 --> 00:40:39.157
Good?

00:40:42.292 --> 00:40:45.876
Sign on the dotted line.

00:41:04.486 --> 00:41:06.111
There you go.

00:41:08.616 --> 00:41:09.647
There you go.

00:41:10.159 --> 00:41:14.455
- It's beautiful. - Yes...

00:41:21.882 --> 00:41:24.884
That's wonderful, Fitz.

00:41:26.304 --> 00:41:29.590
- Do you like it? - It's fantastic.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:34.978
Be careful. It's very slippery.

00:41:37.192 --> 00:41:39.564
This is the engine room.

00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:48.495
Let's go upstairs, to the roof.

00:41:52.878 --> 00:41:54.372
No, wait.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.338
- I'll go ahead. - Yes.

00:42:13.986 --> 00:42:15.979
According to our contract!

00:42:16.073 --> 00:42:18.397
Gentlemen, let's go in.

00:42:28.254 --> 00:42:31.753
Now that we've closed the sale of the boat...

00:42:32.592 --> 00:42:34.668
Let me be frank.

00:42:34.803 --> 00:42:35.834
I beg you.

00:42:35.929 --> 00:42:38.552
I forced him to hire Cholo as a mechanic...

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.007
Because otherwise, he wouldn't have gotten the ship.

00:42:43.688 --> 00:42:45.183
Yes, I know.

00:42:45.399 --> 00:42:52.482
He's an excellent mechanic, I assure you.

00:42:56.371 --> 00:42:58.031
And what else is he?

00:42:58.123 --> 00:43:01.706
The reason behind all this, and excuse my frankness...

00:43:01.836 --> 00:43:06.166
I want to know what our competitors are doing.

00:43:06.466 --> 00:43:10.760
I don't want our properties contested.

00:43:11.472 --> 00:43:13.299
Don't worry.

00:43:14.017 --> 00:43:16.769
Anyone who owns a ship is a potential enemy...

00:43:16.895 --> 00:43:20.680
Those who only have one canoe are harmless.

00:43:22.861 --> 00:43:25.697
You know? We made a bet between the two of us...

00:43:25.781 --> 00:43:28.107
about how long it will take to be ruined.

00:43:28.201 --> 00:43:33.706
Don't take it personally, we're in a sporting spirit, right?

00:43:35.417 --> 00:43:37.210
No, only one of us.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.379
I will move a mountain.

00:44:22.933 --> 00:44:25.010
When will it be finished?

00:44:26.397 --> 00:44:28.353
Miss? For tomorrow.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.600
There are days when he tells me tomorrow.

00:44:30.693 --> 00:44:32.484
I hope she's ready for the launch.

00:44:32.529 --> 00:44:33.559
Tomorrow.

00:44:38.661 --> 00:44:41.781
I'd like to know what this guy really wants.

00:45:26.302 --> 00:45:27.500
What's its name?

00:45:27.595 --> 00:45:30.168
Paul Resenbrink. I am Dutch.

00:45:31.308 --> 00:45:33.431
But they call me Orinoco Paul...

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:37.180
Because I know every bend of that river by heart.

00:45:39.942 --> 00:45:42.269
Did you sail these rivers?

00:45:42.905 --> 00:45:45.776
Yes. My last ship was the Adolfo.

00:45:45.908 --> 00:45:49.658
I can't see very well anymore, but that doesn't fool me.

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:52.326
What are you referring to?

00:45:52.458 --> 00:45:55.127
The jungle can be very treacherous.

00:45:55.254 --> 00:45:58.623
It is full of lies, demons, and mirages.

00:45:59.049 --> 00:46:04.389
I learned to distinguish between reality and hallucination.

00:46:06.684 --> 00:46:10.599
I see that you participated in the Pachitea expedition in '96.

00:46:10.814 --> 00:46:12.688
Yes, as a helmsman.

00:46:12.774 --> 00:46:15.148
On the return trip, I was the captain.

00:46:15.612 --> 00:46:19.941
The captain died; there were only five survivors.

00:46:23.286 --> 00:46:26.490
Paul Resenbrink is already the captain.

00:46:26.582 --> 00:46:28.659
Help me recruit the crew.

00:46:30.128 --> 00:46:32.703
We need tough and strong men.

00:46:33.007 --> 00:46:36.424
I'm afraid we'll find few like that here.

00:46:36.511 --> 00:46:38.588
First, a pilot.

00:46:41.267 --> 00:46:44.222
Is there anyone here with experience as a pilot?

00:46:44.312 --> 00:46:46.388
Hello, friends!

00:46:50.404 --> 00:46:51.434
End of the line!

00:46:51.529 --> 00:46:54.733
Leave me alone, shorty! I am Huerequeque.

00:47:01.291 --> 00:47:08.754
Buddy, I'm Huerequeque, the best cook in the Amazon.

00:47:08.883 --> 00:47:12.716
I've worked on all the ships here.

00:47:12.806 --> 00:47:14.299
And, my friend...

00:47:15.182 --> 00:47:18.137
I already know what they say about me.

00:47:18.895 --> 00:47:21.352
Huerequeque is nothing more than a drunkard...

00:47:22.984 --> 00:47:28.192
But this works perfectly.

00:47:30.994 --> 00:47:36.950
And besides, I'm the best marksman in all of Amazonas.

00:47:37.042 --> 00:47:40.377
- What do you think of him? - Upstream and downstream.

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:43.204
- Is he really a good shot? - I've heard he is.

00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:44.628
I'm going to hire him.

00:47:44.718 --> 00:47:47.554
- What's its name? Huere...? - Huerequeque!

00:47:51.559 --> 00:47:54.266
Huerequeque is already our cook.

00:47:54.856 --> 00:47:56.600
Health!

00:48:03.282 --> 00:48:05.904
Please understand. Who bought the ship?

00:48:06.036 --> 00:48:09.868
Who paid for the ship? I have the right to go with you!

00:48:09.957 --> 00:48:14.206
Molly, you can't leave the girls. What will they do without you?

00:48:14.587 --> 00:48:18.538
- And what will I do without you? - I will return.

00:48:20.595 --> 00:48:23.799
Fitz, do you still love me?

00:48:25.184 --> 00:48:27.260
We're partners, you and I.

00:49:24.047 --> 00:49:28.460
Oh, Fitz, you crazy guy.

00:50:18.446 --> 00:50:22.361
Oh, Fitz, that's wonderful.

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:24.194
This is your day, Molly.

00:50:33.422 --> 00:50:35.914
He named him after me! It's more than my heart can bear!

00:50:36.009 --> 00:50:38.334
Darling, I love you.

00:50:39.304 --> 00:50:41.096
Now comes the official part.

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:43.597
Grab it. Throw it hard.

00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:10.539
I will not allow these women to board.

00:51:10.634 --> 00:51:16.174
They are my helpers. I can't cook without them.

00:52:04.449 --> 00:52:06.655
Aren't they going to Ucayali?

00:52:08.036 --> 00:52:12.284
Why go against the current? I thought I was going to Pongo das Mortes.

00:52:12.374 --> 00:52:13.833
You'll see soon enough.

00:52:13.918 --> 00:52:17.122
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald is traveling up the Amazon.

00:53:08.859 --> 00:53:11.611
We are going upstream. Why?

00:53:12.406 --> 00:53:16.024
Because we're going... upstream.

00:53:16.119 --> 00:53:20.248
And from now on, you will only leave the engine room when I tell you to.

00:54:33.753 --> 00:54:36.423
...very pretty dress, girl.

00:54:36.506 --> 00:54:37.586
Leave him alone.

00:54:40.095 --> 00:54:42.550
Come outside. Let's go.

00:54:42.639 --> 00:54:45.889
Come here. Take that off.

00:54:46.102 --> 00:54:52.188
Bastards, what are you doing here? Let go of my girls.

00:56:07.242 --> 00:56:12.948
Dom Fitzcarraldo, Dom Fitzcarraldo!

00:56:13.039 --> 00:56:14.700
He's back, sir, he's back.

00:56:14.792 --> 00:56:18.625
I can't believe it, but it's here.

00:56:19.089 --> 00:56:23.005
Look, the station is almost ready.

00:56:23.093 --> 00:56:24.671
I see you're already a father.

00:56:24.763 --> 00:56:28.596
Yes, yes. I knew you'd be back.

00:56:28.683 --> 00:56:30.972
I worked for six years without pay.

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:33.097
The station is now operational.

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:37.318
I paint the ticket booth every year, but it always gets dirty.

00:56:37.402 --> 00:56:41.401
I hope your trains cross the Amazon mountains...

00:56:41.449 --> 00:56:44.367
And then everything will change.

00:56:44.453 --> 00:56:48.665
Perhaps then you can pay me something, can't you, Dom Fitzcarraldo?

00:56:48.875 --> 00:56:54.748
Look, the gears are turning...

00:56:54.841 --> 00:56:58.211
But I must confess something to you...

00:56:58.344 --> 00:57:03.766
I had to sell some iron parts and tools to the Indians.

00:57:03.851 --> 00:57:08.265
So that they could make machetes and other things.

00:57:08.356 --> 00:57:11.477
You already know, you can't get iron around here.

00:57:11.569 --> 00:57:17.075
They came at night to steal, so I had to sell.

00:57:17.117 --> 00:57:20.237
Otherwise, they would have killed me. They're worse than criminals.

00:57:21.247 --> 00:57:24.202
I'm alone here, what else could I do?

00:57:24.292 --> 00:57:27.827
I thought they fired him like everyone else.

00:57:30.258 --> 00:57:35.764
Let me show you something out there. Now, the tracks go 200m into the jungle.

00:57:39.811 --> 00:57:43.644
Come, I'll show you how I protect the tracks from the Indians.

00:57:43.732 --> 00:57:49.357
Beware of snakes.

00:57:50.782 --> 00:57:54.034
First I turn on the generator...

00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:58.285
So I connect a long, very long cable to the rails.

00:57:58.375 --> 00:58:02.540
When the Indians try to steal the railroad tracks, they burn their fingers.

00:58:02.631 --> 00:58:06.878
I kill snakes the same way; they turn to ashes.

00:58:08.638 --> 00:58:14.677
I clean the engine every year. When will the work resume?

00:58:15.981 --> 00:58:20.643
Well... the truth is we came for another project.

00:58:21.988 --> 00:58:25.903
Our financial situation will change completely if everything goes well.

00:58:27.785 --> 00:58:31.487
What I mean is that...

00:58:31.958 --> 00:58:34.247
We need the train tracks for something else.

00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:50.854
Not those tracks! Not the ones underneath the locomotive!

00:58:56.278 --> 00:59:00.147
Dom Fitzcarraldo! Dom Fitzcarraldo!

00:59:01.243 --> 00:59:03.817
Dom Fitzcarraldo, Dom Fitzcarraldo!

00:59:03.913 --> 00:59:07.614
They're taking the tracks from underneath the locomotive!

00:59:07.709 --> 00:59:10.378
Leave them so you can move the locomotive.

00:59:10.463 --> 00:59:11.542
Stop them!

00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:15.837
Leave those tracks alone, there's more in the jungle.

00:59:17.847 --> 00:59:21.096
- Thank you, thank you, thank you! - Okay, okay.

00:59:49.634 --> 00:59:52.589
We should have arrived in Pachitea a long time ago.

00:59:53.097 --> 00:59:55.137
Because we haven't arrived yet.

00:59:55.809 --> 00:59:57.683
But according to the map...

00:59:58.145 --> 01:00:00.138
I don't trust maps.

01:00:01.732 --> 01:00:03.725
How can you be so sure?

01:00:17.251 --> 01:00:21.332
No river tastes like the Pachitea. It's right up ahead.

01:00:22.174 --> 01:00:23.752
Go...

01:01:43.439 --> 01:01:45.182
What's going on here?

01:01:45.524 --> 01:01:47.897
We are going up Pachitea.

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:52.239
He is sure?

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:24.350
Your mother!

01:02:26.573 --> 01:02:29.065
Where are we going? Damn it!

01:02:29.369 --> 01:02:32.205
Friends, welcome to Pachitea...

01:02:32.288 --> 01:02:35.658
known for the hospitality of its natives.

01:03:03.368 --> 01:03:05.610
Something is happening down there.

01:03:05.704 --> 01:03:08.706
They don't seem to agree with our direction.

01:03:10.335 --> 01:03:11.580
What?

01:03:18.679 --> 01:03:19.959
A line of ignorant people.

01:03:20.055 --> 01:03:22.095
We are going to Pachitea.

01:03:22.141 --> 01:03:26.804
It's your fault, damn it...

01:03:36.325 --> 01:03:38.994
In Iquitos I said I needed men...

01:03:39.036 --> 01:03:41.528
Not cowards who shit in their underwear.

01:03:45.585 --> 01:03:46.749
Good...

01:03:48.507 --> 01:03:51.294
Whoever wants to go back, should take a step forward.

01:04:33.977 --> 01:04:36.766
Welcome to Saramiriza.

01:04:40.193 --> 01:04:42.519
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald.

01:04:42.556 --> 01:04:44.633
We believed it was an official mission.

01:04:46.033 --> 01:04:48.572
- Hello, Father. - Welcome.

01:04:49.871 --> 01:04:51.579
- Hello, Father. - Welcome.

01:04:52.207 --> 01:04:54.913
Welcome.

01:05:14.818 --> 01:05:16.941
Thank you, thank you.

01:05:19.741 --> 01:05:23.158
How can one learn patriotism from a school textbook?

01:05:23.245 --> 01:05:24.989
That's what the Government demands.

01:05:25.373 --> 01:05:29.039
Indigenous people have become accustomed to this, just as they have to vaccines.

01:05:29.378 --> 01:05:32.130
The boys already feel Peruvian.

01:05:32.214 --> 01:05:35.750
The other day I asked them: "Are they Indians?"

01:05:35.843 --> 01:05:37.587
"No," they replied.

01:05:37.679 --> 01:05:40.253
"Those upstream, those are the real Indians."

01:05:40.349 --> 01:05:42.924
"And what about those who are indigenous?", I asked them.

01:05:43.227 --> 01:05:48.602
"Indians are people who don't know how to read or wash clothes."

01:05:49.193 --> 01:05:51.435
And what do the elders say?

01:05:51.571 --> 01:05:57.112
It seems we can't change their minds...

01:05:57.203 --> 01:06:00.572
that our life is nothing more than an illusion...

01:06:00.666 --> 01:06:03.750
Beyond that lies the reality of dreams.

01:06:06.338 --> 01:06:08.629
I find these ideas very interesting.

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:11.376
I am an opera specialist.

01:06:13.556 --> 01:06:17.056
What do you know about the Jívaro people upriver?

01:06:17.144 --> 01:06:20.098
I was at the 1996 disaster.

01:06:20.398 --> 01:06:23.185
Did they establish any contact after that?

01:06:23.401 --> 01:06:27.482
Yes, a few years ago two brothers left with the Indians.

01:06:27.573 --> 01:06:29.649
One of them returned shortly after...

01:06:29.742 --> 01:06:33.443
and said that the Jivaros had entered the jungle.

01:06:33.538 --> 01:06:36.326
The expedition disappeared without a trace.

01:06:36.416 --> 01:06:38.374
A few weeks ago, one of our brothers

01:06:38.375 --> 01:06:40.331
He went for a swim upstream... and found the body.

01:06:40.421 --> 01:06:44.255
They filled his stomach with stones and took his head.

01:06:45.677 --> 01:06:48.466
Tell me, what are you looking for upstream?

01:06:51.143 --> 01:06:53.385
I have a topographic survey project.

01:06:55.983 --> 01:06:57.560
Paul!

01:07:06.871 --> 01:07:11.249
Shut up, you damned drunks! That's enough!

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:38.529
Assert your authority, or you might as well look for another captain.

01:07:40.286 --> 01:07:41.614
What happened?

01:07:42.622 --> 01:07:45.908
Evaristo Chávez and Fabiano, the Brazilian.

01:07:46.001 --> 01:07:51.079
They and the ladies have to disembark immediately.

01:07:51.966 --> 01:07:55.668
E Huerequeque. He's clever but not trustworthy.

01:08:03.271 --> 01:08:05.347
They're fired.

01:08:05.441 --> 01:08:08.443
You have two minutes to gather your belongings.

01:08:08.527 --> 01:08:12.229
You'll regret it...

01:08:14.785 --> 01:08:16.992
You, too.

01:08:17.705 --> 01:08:19.283
Come on, let's go.

01:08:22.294 --> 01:08:24.121
See the others.

01:08:24.505 --> 01:08:26.878
And the rest, to your posts.

01:08:27.551 --> 01:08:29.128
Let's get to work!

01:12:08.151 --> 01:12:11.317
Reduce speed, to half speed.

01:12:17.829 --> 01:12:19.822
What are the men doing?

01:12:29.802 --> 01:12:31.712
They armed themselves.

01:12:32.971 --> 01:12:35.464
They must not fire under any circumstances.

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:39.765
That was our mistake on the first expedition.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:45.105
Go down and tell them this, if you don't want there to be a disaster.

01:13:11.769 --> 01:13:14.640
What the hell are you doing?

01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:19.235
I'm just trying to communicate with our invisible friends.

01:13:19.319 --> 01:13:22.357
Idiot! This could cost us our heads. First yours.

01:14:22.228 --> 01:14:25.598
There are silences and silences.

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:29.066
I don't like this one at all.

01:14:37.289 --> 01:14:39.780
There's something in the water.

01:14:42.545 --> 01:14:43.707
Where?

01:14:44.422 --> 01:14:47.674
Something dark is floating towards us.

01:15:35.358 --> 01:15:37.731
What is an umbrella doing here?

01:15:37.861 --> 01:15:41.907
It must have belonged to one of the missionaries that the Jivaros killed.

01:15:46.788 --> 01:15:48.581
How strange...

01:15:52.337 --> 01:15:56.750
It sounds like a final warning from the naked butts.

01:15:57.260 --> 01:15:59.467
They love flowery gestures.

01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:19.948
Now it's Caruso's turn.

01:17:55.152 --> 01:17:57.691
Do you see the Indians in the canoe?

01:17:58.364 --> 01:18:00.524
Could it be a trap?

01:18:00.617 --> 01:18:02.859
It does not seem.

01:18:03.203 --> 01:18:05.611
No, I don't think so.

01:18:06.373 --> 01:18:09.625
They would attack at night...

01:18:09.712 --> 01:18:11.372
in larger groups.

01:18:15.051 --> 01:18:17.721
Shall we stop to make contact?

01:18:17.804 --> 01:18:20.094
No, we're not going to stop.

01:18:20.182 --> 01:18:22.259
They wouldn't talk to us either.

01:18:47.966 --> 01:18:49.966
Something is moving there.

01:18:52.471 --> 01:18:55.342
These indigenous people had never heard anything like it.

01:18:55.475 --> 01:18:57.303
This will teach them to respect us.

01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:37.059
Tell me everything you know about them.

01:19:42.365 --> 01:19:45.117
It all depends on how we act.

01:19:46.828 --> 01:19:51.824
The Jivaro people left the interior of Brazil 300 years ago.

01:19:52.210 --> 01:19:55.413
For ten generations they wandered through the jungle...

01:19:55.505 --> 01:19:59.339
In search of a white god on a sacred ship.

01:19:59.468 --> 01:20:03.716
At the end of their pilgrimage, the god will guide them to a place where...

01:20:03.807 --> 01:20:08.137
There is neither pain nor death, a place where people never grow old.

01:20:09.397 --> 01:20:12.233
We will take advantage of this myth.

01:20:24.791 --> 01:20:26.915
What the hell does this have to do with us?

01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:32.045
If a bald-ass comes near me, I'll put a bullet between his eyes.

01:20:32.258 --> 01:20:34.417
But this god doesn't arrive with cannons...

01:20:36.513 --> 01:20:39.005
...he arrives with Caruso's voice.

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:37.286
His loyal crew deserted.

01:21:37.670 --> 01:21:39.912
This is the end of the journey.

01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:54.096
Why didn't you go with them?

01:21:55.321 --> 01:21:57.407
Because I want to return on this damned ship.

01:21:59.831 --> 01:22:02.959
Don't cross my path. Now I'll do whatever I want here.

01:22:07.934 --> 01:22:09.498
Just keep the engine running.

01:22:25.024 --> 01:22:26.066
Oh, those bastards!

01:22:29.616 --> 01:22:30.659
They attacked me by surprise.

01:22:32.461 --> 01:22:33.504
Those bastards!

01:22:36.804 --> 01:22:38.890
I already told you they were useless.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.006
We'll never get out of here alive.

01:22:42.662 --> 01:22:44.748
It's just the three of us left. You, me, and Cholo.

01:22:44.770 --> 01:22:45.812
How, him?

01:22:45.813 --> 01:22:46.360
Renato Ximenes

01:22:48.723 --> 01:22:50.686
What do we need now?

01:22:50.687 --> 01:22:52.650
Is it desperately a good Italian opera?

01:24:43.312 --> 01:24:45.963
Well, gentlemen, this is the end. The dream is over.

01:24:51.955 --> 01:24:54.607
Can we rotate 180º?

01:24:58.119 --> 01:25:00.159
Try.

01:25:12.244 --> 01:25:13.880
Forget about it.

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.190
What did he say?

01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:22.386
Turn around.

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:26.653
Do you see the same thing I do?

01:25:26.707 --> 01:25:28.812
That's all we needed.

01:25:29.595 --> 01:25:32.328
If we try to pass, it will be our end.

01:25:34.567 --> 01:25:37.188
There is only one way, to move forward.

01:25:39.687 --> 01:25:42.772
It's best that we get closer to the shore.

01:25:44.168 --> 01:25:46.384
Go to the engine room, but slowly.

01:25:53.333 --> 01:25:56.684
They are armed with bows and arrows...

01:25:58.924 --> 01:26:00.695
But they keep their distance.

01:26:00.708 --> 01:26:02.059
Had you seen anything like this before?

01:26:02.776 --> 01:26:04.174
No, never.

01:26:12.433 --> 01:26:15.401
Damn them, now they're blocking our path.

01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:53.591
Are they still there?

01:26:54.254 --> 01:26:58.498
Yes! Now there are even more, maybe a hundred canoes.

01:27:00.114 --> 01:27:01.891
Let me know when the New Year begins.

01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:05.498
I want to liven up my last hour with fireworks.

01:27:42.583 --> 01:27:46.031
Friends, you arrived just in time!

01:27:46.069 --> 01:27:49.188
This is where you drink a beer!

01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:52.620
Come and have a drink! There's something for everyone!

01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.491
- Where did you come from? - I was sleeping.

01:27:57.218 --> 01:27:59.309
Where are the others? Did they leave? I already suspected that.

01:27:59.910 --> 01:28:03.504
They are cowards, degenerates! Wretches!

01:28:03.608 --> 01:28:04.689
Get out!

01:33:01.836 --> 01:33:03.066
What are they saying?

01:33:03.584 --> 01:33:05.042
They're talking about our ship...

01:33:06.065 --> 01:33:10.521
the sacred ship, with the white god from whom they await salvation.

01:33:11.383 --> 01:33:15.131
They believe there is a curse on this land.

01:33:17.114 --> 01:33:20.893
They know we're not gods, but the ship impressed them.

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:25.122
But why are they playing that flute? I don't know what they want.

01:33:37.537 --> 01:33:41.224
Friends, I think our journey isn't over yet.

01:34:39.638 --> 01:34:42.082
Do you see that reddish cliff beneath the trees?

01:34:42.697 --> 01:34:43.745
Try.

01:34:44.952 --> 01:34:46.533
It must be there.

01:34:46.922 --> 01:34:47.969
Good.

01:34:48.177 --> 01:34:51.713
However... We can't continue or we'll run aground on a sandbank.

01:34:53.733 --> 01:34:58.475
This slope may seem insignificant, but it will mark my destiny.

01:35:16.654 --> 01:35:18.507
Come on, follow me!

01:35:24.704 --> 01:35:26.868
Now he will show his cards.

01:35:52.168 --> 01:35:53.923
Here it is.

01:35:57.242 --> 01:35:59.563
This is exactly what we were looking for.

01:36:02.010 --> 01:36:03.661
This? Here?

01:36:04.536 --> 01:36:09.717
Do we have to climb a tree for them to understand, you ignorant fools?

01:36:10.982 --> 01:36:15.767
We'll build a platform up there for you gentlemen.

01:36:39.889 --> 01:36:42.068
I can't believe this.

01:36:42.613 --> 01:36:44.730
Ali is or Ucayali.

01:36:45.961 --> 01:36:51.365
The entire river above Pongo das Mortes belongs to us.

01:36:51.394 --> 01:36:54.304
I know, I know. We'll build a tunnel for the railroad.

01:36:54.732 --> 01:36:56.516
No no.

01:36:56.862 --> 01:36:59.562
We will drag the ship over the mountain.

01:37:00.363 --> 01:37:02.571
And the Indians will help us.

01:37:03.546 --> 01:37:05.661
How the hell do you think I got it?

01:37:05.682 --> 01:37:08.033
Just like cows got to the moon.

01:37:08.639 --> 01:37:10.723
I liked that.

01:37:13.841 --> 01:37:15.552
Count on me.

01:37:25.856 --> 01:37:27.110
Yes, come in.

01:37:32.686 --> 01:37:34.085
What it was?

01:37:34.121 --> 01:37:36.477
I still don't understand what you're proposing.

01:37:37.596 --> 01:37:39.716
Come in, I'll show you.

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:53.654
This is the Amazon.

01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:59.286
Here is Iquitos.

01:38:00.522 --> 01:38:06.027
This is Ucayali... isn't it?

01:38:07.856 --> 01:38:09.403
And here...

01:38:10.015 --> 01:38:12.958
We have Pachitea.

01:38:13.671 --> 01:38:14.759
Good...

01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:21.955
We went up the Amazon...

01:38:22.391 --> 01:38:25.058
and then Pachitea.

01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:30.301
This is where we are now.

01:38:31.810 --> 01:38:35.370
And where will we drag the ship up this mountain?

01:38:37.908 --> 01:38:40.409
From here to here...

01:38:41.067 --> 01:38:46.753
The ship will collect rubber from thousands of workers.

01:38:48.152 --> 01:38:50.507
And why don't we go up the Ucayali?

01:38:51.376 --> 01:38:53.588
Because of the Pongo of Deaths.

01:38:53.802 --> 01:38:56.436
No one has ever managed to cross those whirlpools.

01:38:56.541 --> 01:38:59.903
And how are you going to transport the rubber to Iquitos?

01:39:00.162 --> 01:39:02.319
We will need another ship.

01:39:02.572 --> 01:39:06.451
We will transport the rubber up the mountain, where we will build a storage facility.

01:39:06.597 --> 01:39:08.638
Well, soon we'll be so rich...

01:39:08.702 --> 01:39:13.377
We will have all the ships we need to take her to Iquitos.

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:18.702
I explained our project to him.

01:39:18.712 --> 01:39:21.090
- And what did he answer? - He said yes.

01:41:49.195 --> 01:41:51.305
a little further to the left...

01:41:52.008 --> 01:41:53.988
a little more...

01:41:54.025 --> 01:41:55.052
Better!

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.909
a little further to our right...

01:42:00.882 --> 01:42:03.343
Okay... fine!

01:42:04.813 --> 01:42:06.066
Quiet!

01:42:06.553 --> 01:42:07.428
a little more...

01:42:07.809 --> 01:42:08.856
Alright, be quiet!

01:42:42.871 --> 01:42:45.206
If it wasn't a pretty big mess...

01:42:47.716 --> 01:42:49.824
That wasn't a bad start, was it?

01:42:52.695 --> 01:42:56.654
They even left two children here. That's a good sign.

01:43:08.052 --> 01:43:12.052
What do you think? Will the indigenous people continue to help us?

01:43:12.949 --> 01:43:15.104
Nobody knows what they really think.

01:43:15.325 --> 01:43:18.711
But how on earth do you plan to get the ship up the mountain?

01:43:21.156 --> 01:43:24.811
And if nothing else works, we can build a tunnel.

01:43:25.951 --> 01:43:28.147
I could do it myself...

01:43:28.530 --> 01:43:30.866
If it had a perfect pulley system.

01:43:33.031 --> 01:43:36.035
But I would need 16 km of rope...

01:43:36.138 --> 01:43:39.058
and it would take them 10 weeks to grow 25 cm.

01:43:39.178 --> 01:43:41.235
Unfortunately, we don't have that much time.

01:43:41.564 --> 01:43:44.029
We still have 7 months left before the option wins.

01:43:45.115 --> 01:43:48.079
We have a winch and the strength of hundreds of Indians.

01:43:49.495 --> 01:43:52.048
We will make the ship climb the mountain.

01:44:25.523 --> 01:44:26.959
Who are your little friends?

01:44:27.646 --> 01:44:28.871
McNamara.

01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:33.486
McNamara is my assistant. And this is the commander.

01:44:34.674 --> 01:44:37.102
I drink to your health, McNamara.

01:44:47.373 --> 01:44:49.034
Ovitaro. Tovero mas...

01:44:49.597 --> 01:44:51.724
Tovero more, tovero more on him.

01:44:53.051 --> 01:44:55.201
Oh, overo, ovitaro, ovitaro, let me eat in peace...

01:44:57.422 --> 01:44:59.818
More and more, more and more, side by side, side by side...

01:45:31.069 --> 01:45:33.441
The difference in elevation is greater than I thought.

01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:37.634
Now that there are no more trees...

01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:40.745
You can see how tilted it is.

01:45:42.145 --> 01:45:46.071
We'll have to level the ground, build a ramp...

01:45:47.239 --> 01:45:52.599
And up there, we'll have to make a good cut all the way to the top.

01:45:53.833 --> 01:45:55.676
This could take months.

01:45:56.216 --> 01:45:58.804
With dynamite! I hope we have enough.

01:45:59.425 --> 01:46:01.221
No! I wouldn't advise it...

01:46:02.395 --> 01:46:04.460
We have no other option.

01:47:03.776 --> 01:47:05.236
Take shelter!

01:47:05.966 --> 01:47:08.019
Warning! Dangerous! Dangerous!

01:47:14.076 --> 01:47:18.501
Wait! Wait! Where are you going?

01:47:19.051 --> 01:47:20.898
Get back to work, come on, come on.

01:47:22.107 --> 01:47:24.088
Get back to work.

01:49:52.009 --> 01:49:53.766
Huerequeque!

01:49:55.715 --> 01:49:57.647
We start here, come along.

01:50:01.048 --> 01:50:03.736
Give them a hand. Come on!

01:50:04.006 --> 01:50:06.956
How will this log withstand being pulled by hundreds of tons?

01:50:06.959 --> 01:50:08.153
He will endure.

01:50:09.225 --> 01:50:11.183
It is buried at a great depth.

01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:13.915
This wood is as strong as iron.

01:50:15.635 --> 01:50:17.228
Bring it here.

01:50:37.884 --> 01:50:39.222
Come with me.

01:50:51.607 --> 01:50:53.985
Tell them to go to the other side.

01:50:58.887 --> 01:51:01.011
All of you, go there!

01:52:09.963 --> 01:52:11.159
Careful!

01:52:19.515 --> 01:52:20.581
Slowly!

01:53:03.759 --> 01:53:08.131
If I had known you were planning to take the ship up the rails...

01:53:08.685 --> 01:53:11.654
He would have told them to leave them at his station in the Amazon.

01:53:22.221 --> 01:53:23.967
I'm sorry I can't help you.

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.293
I drank too much last night.

01:53:50.474 --> 01:53:52.606
Shouldn't we say that the ice melts?

01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:55.448
In their language, the word "ice" does not exist.

01:54:41.146 --> 01:54:43.120
That's enough! Get out! Get out of here!

01:54:45.342 --> 01:54:47.209
In front!

01:55:41.919 --> 01:55:44.887
Try with all your might! More might!

01:55:50.932 --> 01:55:52.576
Try again!

01:56:01.804 --> 01:56:02.865
It's moving!

01:56:03.653 --> 01:56:05.865
It's moving! It's moving!

01:56:09.843 --> 01:56:11.535
Watch out! Watch out!

01:59:02.991 --> 01:59:06.232
They stayed like that for two days and two nights, watching the water.

01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:09.717
It was certainly because of that horrible accident.

01:59:10.424 --> 01:59:12.507
I couldn't get a single word out of them.

01:59:35.231 --> 01:59:36.160
They're gone.

01:59:36.641 --> 01:59:38.733
Everyone? They're all gone?

01:59:40.979 --> 01:59:42.344
How do you know?

01:59:43.099 --> 01:59:45.253
I had a feeling and I went to check it out.

01:59:46.527 --> 01:59:50.227
Not a soul, nobody. They've all disappeared.

01:59:50.594 --> 01:59:52.359
This could mean many things.

01:59:52.664 --> 01:59:54.922
Perhaps they will attack us now, but we cannot defend ourselves.

01:59:56.521 --> 01:59:58.244
Everyone abandoned us.

01:59:58.425 --> 02:00:00.267
Except for my assistant McNamara.

02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:02.771
And that's why he'll be a boss someday.

02:00:56.267 --> 02:00:59.503
They all returned, as if they had never left.

02:01:04.211 --> 02:01:05.939
Don't ask me to explain.

02:01:27.664 --> 02:01:29.382
Two men died!

02:01:30.091 --> 02:01:31.623
I can't believe this crazy idea that

02:01:31.625 --> 02:01:33.155
Huerequeque had.

02:01:33.569 --> 02:01:35.376
Friends, the engine is running.

02:01:35.901 --> 02:01:38.048
That's what I call intellectual work.

02:01:38.376 --> 02:01:39.314
Two men died!

02:01:39.685 --> 02:01:43.564
We can remove the engine and attach the anchor to the winch.

02:01:43.859 --> 02:01:45.860
Thus the ship will rise by its own power.

02:01:46.650 --> 02:01:48.351
So, what do you say? Tell me?

02:03:38.733 --> 02:03:42.339
Sometimes the brain of an unfortunate peasant also works.

02:03:42.777 --> 02:03:45.033
You are not an unhappy peasant!

02:03:45.035 --> 02:03:47.290
He's the best drunk that ever lived on this Earth!

02:03:47.553 --> 02:03:49.509
- But we forgot something! - What?

02:03:49.961 --> 02:03:52.762
Caruso! Enrico Caruso!

02:05:42.395 --> 02:05:43.589
Why do they do all this?

02:05:45.639 --> 02:05:48.242
Why do they work like animals for us?

02:05:51.195 --> 02:05:51.938
Why?

02:05:53.951 --> 02:05:54.984
Why, why?

02:05:56.485 --> 02:05:57.331
Why?

02:06:00.213 --> 02:06:01.073
Why?

02:06:01.366 --> 02:06:04.098
I don't know either. I really don't know.

02:06:04.454 --> 02:06:07.362
But I assure you there will be a reason.

02:06:07.738 --> 02:06:10.939
I'm convinced they're planning something.

02:06:26.101 --> 02:06:27.064
You should drink.

02:06:28.065 --> 02:06:31.286
It's yucca with fermented saliva.

02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:32.227
Come on, baby.

02:06:32.544 --> 02:06:36.404
My God, time flies, and we haven't accomplished anything.

02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:17.779
They're plotting something.

02:09:18.029 --> 02:09:20.755
The Indians are preparing barbasco, a very potent poison...

02:09:21.071 --> 02:09:22.575
And, in addition, they paint themselves black.

02:09:23.088 --> 02:09:28.285
And most of them hid in the jungle and are armed.

02:09:43.537 --> 02:09:44.610
What does this mean?

02:09:44.932 --> 02:09:47.888
It means they believe they are invisible.

02:09:48.777 --> 02:09:52.333
They only do it when they go hunting or to war.

02:09:56.900 --> 02:09:59.451
Shouldn't we go back to the ship and load the rifles?

02:09:59.566 --> 02:10:01.628
No, we wouldn't have a chance.

02:10:19.730 --> 02:10:21.915
They're planning something...

02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:28.105
Perhaps they are calculating the exact size of our heads.

02:10:29.605 --> 02:10:31.108
For now, we are not in danger.

02:10:32.614 --> 02:10:33.773
How do you know?

02:10:35.685 --> 02:10:36.781
There is a clue.

02:10:38.290 --> 02:10:39.048
Look.

02:10:40.718 --> 02:10:42.653
Do you see those hands on the tracks?

02:20:40.134 --> 02:20:41.371
What happened?

02:20:41.476 --> 02:20:44.627
Pongo! Let's go to Pongo!

02:20:44.816 --> 02:20:46.051
Cholo!

02:21:00.472 --> 02:21:01.667
Cholo!

02:21:02.159 --> 02:21:03.972
Paul, Come on!

02:21:04.505 --> 02:21:06.927
I have to stop the ship.

02:21:14.750 --> 02:21:19.776
- Pongo! Let's go to Pongo! - Open the boiler, quick!

02:21:20.362 --> 02:21:22.319
Valves first!

02:21:50.904 --> 02:21:53.301
Oh my God! My ship!

02:22:11.710 --> 02:22:14.782
Damn it! It's too late now.

02:25:40.093 --> 02:25:41.632
Do you know what you're saying?

02:25:41.946 --> 02:25:44.737
He said that they released the moorings last night.

02:25:45.142 --> 02:25:48.102
They knew the sacred ship would ascend the mountain...

02:25:48.365 --> 02:25:50.381
so that it could pass freely through Pongo.

02:25:50.964 --> 02:25:55.470
They had to do it to appease the evil spirits of the whirlwinds.

02:25:56.054 --> 02:25:57.386
I have to stop my ship.

02:27:32.972 --> 02:27:35.526
First of all, take a sip.

02:27:36.606 --> 02:27:38.916
Crossing the Pongo River in a ship

02:27:38.917 --> 02:27:41.227
Steam power is something that will never happen again.

02:27:41.496 --> 02:27:43.047
That's quite an achievement.

02:27:43.604 --> 02:27:44.758
Grab your glass. Drink.

02:27:47.219 --> 02:27:50.434
Extraordinary, friends! Extraordinary!

02:27:51.499 --> 02:27:52.397
Take care. To your health!

02:27:52.877 --> 02:27:55.784
To appease the evil spirits of Pongo!

02:28:09.474 --> 02:28:10.719
I'll tell you a story.

02:28:12.708 --> 02:28:15.100
When North America had not yet been fully explored...

02:28:16.117 --> 02:28:19.332
A French pioneer headed west from Montreal...

02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:25.008
He was the first white person to see Niagara Falls.

02:28:27.523 --> 02:28:30.023
When he returned, he said that he had seen

02:28:30.024 --> 02:28:32.523
the most immense and spectacular waterfalls...

02:28:32.854 --> 02:28:34.603
more than anyone could ever dream of.

02:28:37.078 --> 02:28:38.311
They didn't believe him.

02:28:39.206 --> 02:28:40.729
They thought he was crazy or a fraud.

02:28:43.468 --> 02:28:45.350
They asked him: "What proof do you have?"

02:28:48.478 --> 02:28:49.876
And he would answer:

02:28:52.254 --> 02:28:53.406
"My proof is..."

02:28:55.968 --> 02:28:57.338
that I saw them...

02:29:07.879 --> 02:29:11.718
I'm sorry, but I don't know what this has to do with me.

02:29:18.093 --> 02:29:20.095
What plans do you have? What do you intend to do now?

02:29:20.875 --> 02:29:21.872
I don't know.

02:29:23.534 --> 02:29:28.966
I'm asking because I'm interested in buying the ship again.

02:29:29.425 --> 02:29:32.166
My business has expanded lately.

02:29:32.423 --> 02:29:34.269
The damage could be repaired in a few days.

02:29:36.523 --> 02:29:43.552
I assure you that I do not intend to take advantage of your delicate situation.

02:29:43.589 --> 02:29:50.581
It comes from Manaus... I just found out that the European Opera Company...

02:29:50.811 --> 02:29:52.757
...will give a presentation.

02:29:53.130 --> 02:29:54.392
I think I should go.

02:29:55.355 --> 02:29:58.922
They say they're going to stage a sensational German composer...

02:30:00.300 --> 02:30:01.819
one of the most modern...

02:30:02.338 --> 02:30:06.107
Federico, Roberto, Ricardo...

02:30:06.746 --> 02:30:07.771
What's your name? Ricardo...

02:30:07.780 --> 02:30:10.207
Wagner! He's the author of "Parsifal".

02:30:11.590 --> 02:30:15.232
Yes, yes, it must be that one. A very Teutonic song.

02:30:15.624 --> 02:30:18.227
And the opera is called "The Puritans".

02:30:18.652 --> 02:30:21.100
No, that's an Italian opera by Bellini.

02:30:27.817 --> 02:30:28.851
Listen...

02:30:31.739 --> 02:30:33.292
Was he serious about the ship?

02:30:35.789 --> 02:30:36.985
Hey, Cholo! They needed it!

02:30:37.001 --> 02:30:37.893
Come closer.

02:30:39.026 --> 02:30:40.273
- Paul! - Yes?

02:30:48.444 --> 02:30:51.028
Friends, the new owner of Molly Aida.

02:30:51.412 --> 02:30:53.300
But we can still use the ship for two weeks.

02:30:53.601 --> 02:30:57.746
Paul, listen. I hate having to give you up.

02:30:58.687 --> 02:31:00.437
Go to Manaus with this money...

02:31:02.848 --> 02:31:07.388
And buy me a tailcoat and the finest cigars in the world.

02:31:07.516 --> 02:31:11.260
And from the theater I want an armchair upholstered in red velvet.

02:31:11.688 --> 02:31:15.023
I promised a pig that adores Caruso.

02:31:18.757 --> 02:31:20.080
And then...

02:32:26.967 --> 02:32:28.056
Professor...

02:32:39.095 --> 02:32:42.446
My armchair, my armchair.
