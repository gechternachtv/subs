1
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,750
Hurry up, we're already late!

2
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,708
The important thing is to arrive with elegance.

3
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,131
A few minutes more or less...

4
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:18,044
We'll lose track of Caruso if we don't hurry.

5
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:25,729
You got your face dirty, come here.

6
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:29,941
- Oh, Molly, please. - Isn't this better?

7
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:32,104
Come, for God's sake.

8
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,701
Fitz!

9
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:47,170
The finest champagne for horses.

10
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,467
We'll make it!

11
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:49,639
Madam, sir, you cannot enter.

12
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,604
It's a gala performance.

13
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:55,816
We came from Iquitos, 2,000 km away along the Amazon.

14
00:05:56,693 --> 00:05:58,486
The engine broke down and I had to row.

15
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,946
Look at your hands.

16
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,275
Two days and two nights rowing to see Caruso once in a lifetime.

17
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,528
- Please... - I'm sorry, you don't have tickets.

18
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:11,914
We need to get in at any cost. We don't have entry, but we have the right.

19
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:14,501
They cannot enter.

20
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,901
I will build an opera house in Iquitos.

21
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:17,212
And Caruso will inaugurate it.

22
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:20,043
It will be the largest opera house the jungle has ever seen.

23
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:21,633
Let us in!

24
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:25,557
He will work with us. Please let us in.

25
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:27,470
I beg you!

26
00:06:30,818 --> 00:06:33,773
I myself would like to be in there.

27
00:06:49,257 --> 00:06:53,207
Remain silent and stand by the wall.

28
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:35,639
He pointed at me. "Yes, of course."

29
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:41,318
- Did you see it for me? - Yes.

30
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:43,274
He pointed at me.

31
00:10:22,848 --> 00:10:24,841
Fitzcarrald?

32
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:27,265
How do you spell that?

33
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:30,352
What a strange name!

34
00:10:31,984 --> 00:10:35,104
My father was Irish. My real name is Fitzgerald.

35
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:37,154
- Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald.

36
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:38,862
The Peruvians couldn't pronounce it.

37
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:42,320
Fitzgerald? From Iquitos?

38
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,868
It won't be the one about the railroad, will it?

39
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,493
Yes, it's me.

40
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:53,005
Well, yes...

41
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:56,592
The one on the trans-Andean railway, but...

42
00:10:58,015 --> 00:10:59,972
You probably already know that my project failed.

43
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:03,470
But it was an excellent idea, and it still is.

44
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:07,390
Now I'm trying my luck as an ice maker.

45
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:14,947
Here, what the rich want is to see European celebrities.

46
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:21,998
Sarah Bernhardt, an actress who can't even sing.

47
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:25,748
But his wooden leg is the talk of the town.

48
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:28,168
The ice...

49
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:31,675
Well, I mean, I'm doing all of this...

50
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:34,514
Because I have a dream...

51
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:36,967
The opera.

52
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:40,224
The great opera of the jungle.

53
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:45,321
Fitzcarraldo will build it, and Caruso will sing at its premiere.

54
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:48,485
Only dreamers move mountains.

55
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,380
For the past 5 years, our city has been the richest in the world.

56
00:11:58,672 --> 00:12:00,914
It's like gold fever.

57
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,502
Please...

58
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:12,764
Soon this theater will be too small.

59
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:16,732
Prices are ten times higher than in New York.

60
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:21,280
Palaces are being built using Dutch ceramics...

61
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,442
and Florentine marble.

62
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,695
Soon Iquitos will be like this.

63
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,824
It's still a border town...

64
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:31,535
But the rubber business is growing by leaps and bounds.

65
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:35,709
The richest people in Manaus, if you'll allow me the expression...

66
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,086
They send their laundry to be done in Lisbon...

67
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:43,592
Because they say the water in the Amazon is impure.

68
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:56,083
Between.

69
00:14:56,177 --> 00:14:58,170
We're home again now.

70
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,802
Did you miss me?

71
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,435
You're not going in?

72
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:16,863
I don't know. I don't really like this.

73
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:20,198
Oh, it's not that big of a deal.

74
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,863
I teach girls how to run a household.

75
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:25,326
This is better than if they were on the street.

76
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:29,290
I have nothing against them.

77
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:30,547
But I can't stand it...

78
00:15:30,635 --> 00:15:33,839
The upper class who believe that with money they can buy everything.

79
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:35,212
And what about opera...?

80
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,304
I have to work in ice production.

81
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:42,727
It could prove its respectability. That wouldn't be bad.

82
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:46,063
That's precisely why I ruined myself.

83
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:54,486
I prefer going to the suburbs. There I'm in my element.

84
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:57,869
- The boys? - Yes, they're my audience.

85
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,075
And a pig.

86
00:16:00,588 --> 00:16:05,167
There's a slow-witted pig who loves me.

87
00:16:05,427 --> 00:16:07,172
How could I not do it?

88
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:34,604
When I build my opera house, it will have its own box and a velvet armchair.

89
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:27,378
It is the result of the chemical reaction of two salts.

90
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:31,331
Ice has many uses, but people don't realize it.

91
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:33,218
The children love it.

92
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:34,679
Yes, they eat it.

93
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:38,809
You're welcome?

94
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:41,978
Someday there will be ice on all ships and in warehouses.

95
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:20,859
Yes, your bets.

96
00:20:22,196 --> 00:20:25,945
- So, what do you think? - I'll tell you what I think.

97
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:29,783
First, you won't be able to get a patent because the process is self-explanatory...

98
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:32,743
It has been in school textbooks for over a hundred years.

99
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:36,786
I know, but I have experience. And that's what counts.

100
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,752
Second, what is the purpose of the ice here?

101
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,710
To cool the rubber?

102
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:45,630
How to make coolers in the jungle, as if by magic?

103
00:20:47,435 --> 00:20:51,432
Or to put sleds on the trains of the Trans-Andean Railway...

104
00:20:51,523 --> 00:20:57,278
Release the brakes, push, and goodbye to the train, down the valley?

105
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:03,323
Let's go!

106
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:09,741
Don't take it the wrong way!

107
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:12,455
Come on, play with us.

108
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:17,584
There's nothing like losing money.

109
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,760
There's nothing like it. Pure ecstasy!

110
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:24,967
This church will remain closed until the city has its opera house.

111
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,341
I want the opera house.

112
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,762
I want my opera house!

113
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,724
I want the opera house!

114
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:44,482
This church will remain closed until the city has its opera house!

115
00:22:45,577 --> 00:22:48,614
I want my opera house!

116
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:51,954
I want my opera house!

117
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:54,376
I want my opera house!

118
00:23:12,902 --> 00:23:14,730
Come on, come on. Come on, get out of here.

119
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,442
Come on... all at once. Now!

120
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:21,326
Now... now... to the tower...

121
00:23:21,412 --> 00:23:23,321
running... he's crazy...

122
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:21,518
He could be locked up for two weeks.

123
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:25,863
Thank you, two days was enough.

124
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,409
Of course, my wife Molly intervened.

125
00:24:32,498 --> 00:24:36,247
You're mistaken. But follow me.

126
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:39,706
I'll show you why I let you leave so quickly.

127
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,954
Come.

128
00:24:48,476 --> 00:24:51,726
- So? - ​​They've been there for two days, day and night.

129
00:24:51,813 --> 00:24:54,304
Even a horse would be moved.

130
00:24:59,863 --> 00:25:02,438
This won't be difficult to organize.

131
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,534
Gather them all at once?

132
00:25:07,665 --> 00:25:10,037
Dom Aquilino, the Borja brothers, and the others?

133
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:12,410
I have my resources, don't worry.

134
00:25:12,504 --> 00:25:14,627
I'll bring all my girls.

135
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:18,049
All the rubber barons will come like flies...

136
00:25:18,136 --> 00:25:20,628
And I will make sure they feel good.

137
00:25:20,765 --> 00:25:23,600
Great, I'll bring my gramophone.

138
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:29,143
First, you need to dress better. I won't let you go like that.

139
00:25:29,232 --> 00:25:33,148
A bath for Mr. Fitzcarraldo, the full service.

140
00:25:33,238 --> 00:25:35,444
And then take him to my room.

141
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:38,653
What are they doing?

142
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:42,576
Help! Molly, tell them to stop!

143
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:55,550
Everyone wants to take money from me: The hospital, the fire department...

144
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,345
And now you fill my ears with your opera.

145
00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:01,306
This would express our best feelings.

146
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:05,394
Our best wishes!

147
00:26:05,486 --> 00:26:07,312
We can't have everything.

148
00:26:08,822 --> 00:26:10,731
Take note of this.

149
00:26:11,451 --> 00:26:13,775
Come closer.

150
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:16,409
Come a little closer.

151
00:26:20,461 --> 00:26:22,750
A small demonstration.

152
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:29,261
A thousand dollars will prove better.

153
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:37,180
Did you see how quickly the money disappears?

154
00:26:37,274 --> 00:26:39,516
You must have experienced this.

155
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:42,695
Of course, a lot of money had to be invested in the railroad.

156
00:26:44,115 --> 00:26:47,532
How exciting it must have been to be ruined!

157
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:49,907
Let's return to our friends.

158
00:26:49,997 --> 00:26:54,707
Yes, the opportunity to see friends and rivals in the same place...

159
00:26:54,752 --> 00:26:56,829
It doesn't appear very often.

160
00:27:24,997 --> 00:27:26,077
Rosita, over here.

161
00:27:26,207 --> 00:27:27,999
And you bring the champagne.

162
00:27:34,593 --> 00:27:37,843
Please pay attention.

163
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:40,509
Please come closer.

164
00:28:31,328 --> 00:28:32,702
Get him out of here!

165
00:28:32,788 --> 00:28:34,946
- What? - Get him out of here!

166
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:41,880
Please, please. One moment, please.

167
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:45,799
Ladies and gentlemen, don't worry.

168
00:28:46,095 --> 00:28:52,385
This man is harmless, he just had a trance.

169
00:28:52,477 --> 00:28:57,225
Sir, my servants will escort you to the kitchen.

170
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,234
My dogs' cook will prepare your dinner.

171
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:05,489
Thank you so much, it was amazing.

172
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,032
By the cook of his dogs.

173
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:15,416
By Verdi.

174
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:19,128
By Rossini.

175
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:23,175
By Caruso.

176
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:26,599
By Fitzcarraldo, the conqueror of the useless.

177
00:29:26,686 --> 00:29:28,181
Your health!

178
00:29:32,693 --> 00:29:35,563
As sure as I am, I'm here...

179
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:38,491
Someday I will bring the Grand Opera to Iquitos.

180
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:42,119
So, I'm going to surpass them...

181
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,788
humble them…

182
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:48,034
I am the spectacle of the forest...

183
00:29:48,338 --> 00:29:50,246
I am the inventor of rubber...

184
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,629
I'm going to delete them.

185
00:29:52,717 --> 00:29:56,845
Sir, the reality of your world...

186
00:29:56,931 --> 00:30:02,721
It's nothing more than a caricature of grand opera.

187
00:30:02,813 --> 00:30:05,767
Fitz, let's go.

188
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:09,276
This man is no longer your opponent; he's already dead.

189
00:30:09,362 --> 00:30:13,313
Madam, I stand firmly on my own two feet.

190
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:15,781
He's a great hunter, isn't he?

191
00:30:15,996 --> 00:30:18,367
What does this have to do with anything?

192
00:30:18,457 --> 00:30:19,785
You should have known.

193
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:22,105
When we shoot an elephant,

194
00:30:22,106 --> 00:30:24,336
Sometimes he can stand for ten days...

195
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:25,881
before it collapses.

196
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:27,081
Goodnight.

197
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:32,088
Come on, Zulma, let's go. This way, let's go.

198
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:47,906
Rubber is the only option.

199
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:50,911
That's where the money is. Forget about the ice.

200
00:30:51,871 --> 00:30:55,740
A large ship is needed...

201
00:30:56,002 --> 00:30:57,627
hundreds of workers...

202
00:30:57,671 --> 00:30:59,413
But above all, land.

203
00:30:59,506 --> 00:31:02,710
There must still be something left. They didn't divide it all.

204
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:04,462
Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.

205
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:06,096
How do you know?

206
00:31:06,182 --> 00:31:09,633
Dom Aquilino was talking about this.

207
00:31:09,726 --> 00:31:10,972
Then forget about it.

208
00:31:12,063 --> 00:31:14,305
Why don't you talk to him?

209
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:29,871
My property begins here where Pongo ends...

210
00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:35,964
and extends 130 km upstream.

211
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:38,127
And what about Pongo?

212
00:31:38,344 --> 00:31:40,836
I wish it were mine too.

213
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:44,763
We are thinking of opening a path through these mountains.

214
00:31:44,853 --> 00:31:47,522
But that would be an impossible task...

215
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:49,815
And even then there wouldn't be...

216
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,932
A ship...?

217
00:31:52,028 --> 00:31:54,187
And nobody managed to go upstream?

218
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,487
Do you want to see it for yourself?

219
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:02,285
We can continue on foot, if you wish.

220
00:32:08,965 --> 00:32:10,293
What does it say?

221
00:32:10,842 --> 00:32:13,001
That we should remain silent.

222
00:32:13,095 --> 00:32:17,557
Whoever speaks will be swallowed by the evil spirits of the whirlwind.

223
00:32:53,393 --> 00:32:57,012
The Indians call whirlpools Chirimagua...

224
00:32:57,148 --> 00:32:59,188
"the choleric spirits".

225
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:03,111
Whoever falls there is lost.

226
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,898
They also say that...

227
00:33:05,992 --> 00:33:09,492
"Water has no hair to cling to."

228
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,191
Is this a rubber tree?

229
00:33:41,702 --> 00:33:44,953
Yes. Brazilian rubber tree.

230
00:33:57,888 --> 00:34:03,049
They call it cauchuch, the weeping tree.

231
00:34:03,394 --> 00:34:06,229
These indigenous people love the flowery language.

232
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:11,566
They call gold the sweat of the sun, and bees the mothers of honey.

233
00:34:14,074 --> 00:34:18,489
It's not easy to civilize them, I assure you.

234
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:36,717
How much do you think that weighs?

235
00:34:38,687 --> 00:34:40,312
60 kilos!

236
00:34:41,107 --> 00:34:44,061
I assume you are familiar with market prices.

237
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,353
How long does it take to make one of these?

238
00:34:46,446 --> 00:34:48,523
Three men, one week.

239
00:34:57,502 --> 00:35:00,871
I currently have 8,500 people working for me...

240
00:35:04,552 --> 00:35:08,799
But I want to reach 10,000.

241
00:35:12,394 --> 00:35:17,272
You're a strange guy, but I have to admit I like you.

242
00:35:57,574 --> 00:36:02,700
Look: my area extends from Pongo to the mouth of the Ucayali River.

243
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:05,992
Above is the Amazon Company of Peru...

244
00:36:06,084 --> 00:36:07,709
a public limited company.

245
00:36:07,794 --> 00:36:09,953
And there are the Borja brothers...

246
00:36:10,048 --> 00:36:11,957
What does this square mean?

247
00:36:12,008 --> 00:36:14,380
It's the rubber zone of the Ucayali...

248
00:36:14,677 --> 00:36:17,169
with 14 million trees.

249
00:36:17,891 --> 00:36:20,298
It's the only area without an owner.

250
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:22,967
due to the whirlpools of Pongo das Mortes...

251
00:36:23,063 --> 00:36:26,599
You would need wings to enter this area.

252
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:29,612
Why is there nothing marked on Pachitea?

253
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:32,532
There are no rubber trees there.

254
00:36:32,616 --> 00:36:36,282
There might be some, but not enough to make it profitable.

255
00:36:36,371 --> 00:36:39,372
The only thing you'll find there are headhunters.

256
00:36:39,457 --> 00:36:45,294
There is no rubber, no gold, nothing.

257
00:36:49,136 --> 00:36:51,213
The two rivers almost meet.

258
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:52,385
As?

259
00:36:54,851 --> 00:36:59,894
Is this map accurate? Is there a more detailed one?

260
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:02,724
It's a pretty good map.

261
00:37:03,862 --> 00:37:09,284
In 1896, a group of surveyors and soldiers arrived at Alto Pachitea.

262
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:11,197
But they killed almost all of them.

263
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:16,788
Later, some missionaries arrived in Saramiriza, their most remote parish.

264
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:21,837
From there you will only find wild Jivara and Campa people.

265
00:37:24,053 --> 00:37:26,723
Two priests ended up with their heads shrunk.

266
00:37:26,807 --> 00:37:29,298
Have you ever seen a shrunken head?

267
00:37:29,518 --> 00:37:30,681
Try...

268
00:37:31,646 --> 00:37:32,844
To mean...

269
00:37:33,856 --> 00:37:36,692
No... Somewhat similar.

270
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:58,672
Have you made your choice yet?

271
00:37:58,762 --> 00:38:02,261
I can't decide, I think I'll keep both.

272
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,760
Molly!

273
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:06,119
- What it was?

274
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,888
I need your money... every penny.

275
00:38:07,982 --> 00:38:10,307
- Oh, Fitz, not again. - I've got an idea.

276
00:38:11,986 --> 00:38:13,777
A fantastic idea.

277
00:38:15,072 --> 00:38:19,487
Look, I brought some maps.

278
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:22,201
I can explain all of that.

279
00:38:37,476 --> 00:38:41,937
First I have to speak to a notary and then get a ship.

280
00:38:42,021 --> 00:38:44,561
My money won't be enough for a boat.

281
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:46,193
Don't worry.

282
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:23,647
- The documents, please. - Thank you.

283
00:39:27,994 --> 00:39:30,402
The acquisition of the area has to follow certain steps.

284
00:39:30,497 --> 00:39:34,081
First, you and your partner sign, then they hand over the money...

285
00:39:34,168 --> 00:39:36,873
And I legalize it with my signature.

286
00:39:37,381 --> 00:39:41,676
But first, I want you to understand the option clause.

287
00:39:41,803 --> 00:39:43,630
Which option clause?

288
00:39:44,848 --> 00:39:49,807
Through its executive bodies, the Peruvian government demands that...

289
00:39:49,937 --> 00:39:53,473
the acquisition of a territory of this size...

290
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:58,479
It must be done by means of a deed and for a trial period of nine months.

291
00:39:58,572 --> 00:40:04,826
You must demonstrate that you are doing everything necessary to explore the region.

292
00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:08,865
Otherwise, they will lose the right to exploit the land.

293
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:13,582
The state has an interest in areas like this being productive...

294
00:40:13,674 --> 00:40:16,166
in the hands of competent people...

295
00:40:16,261 --> 00:40:17,589
as the State is.

296
00:40:17,722 --> 00:40:20,093
Come on, we're wasting time.

297
00:40:20,474 --> 00:40:23,844
May I ask a personal question?

298
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:28,059
Do you really know what you're doing?

299
00:40:29,526 --> 00:40:31,686
We're going to do what no one has done before.

300
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:34,817
We will become very, very rich.

301
00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:39,157
Good?

302
00:40:42,292 --> 00:40:45,876
Sign on the dotted line.

303
00:41:04,486 --> 00:41:06,111
There you go.

304
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:09,647
There you go.

305
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,455
- It's beautiful. - Yes...

306
00:41:21,882 --> 00:41:24,884
That's wonderful, Fitz.

307
00:41:26,304 --> 00:41:29,590
- Do you like it? - It's fantastic.

308
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,978
Be careful. It's very slippery.

309
00:41:37,192 --> 00:41:39,564
This is the engine room.

310
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,495
Let's go upstairs, to the roof.

311
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:54,372
No, wait.

312
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,338
- I'll go ahead. - Yes.

313
00:42:13,986 --> 00:42:15,979
According to our contract!

314
00:42:16,073 --> 00:42:18,397
Gentlemen, let's go in.

315
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,753
Now that we've closed the sale of the boat...

316
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,668
Let me be frank.

317
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:35,834
I beg you.

318
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:38,552
I forced him to hire Cholo as a mechanic...

319
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,007
Because otherwise, he wouldn't have gotten the ship.

320
00:42:43,688 --> 00:42:45,183
Yes, I know.

321
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:52,482
He's an excellent mechanic, I assure you.

322
00:42:56,371 --> 00:42:58,031
And what else is he?

323
00:42:58,123 --> 00:43:01,706
The reason behind all this, and excuse my frankness...

324
00:43:01,836 --> 00:43:06,166
I want to know what our competitors are doing.

325
00:43:06,466 --> 00:43:10,760
I don't want our properties contested.

326
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:13,299
Don't worry.

327
00:43:14,017 --> 00:43:16,769
Anyone who owns a ship is a potential enemy...

328
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:20,680
Those who only have one canoe are harmless.

329
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:25,697
You know? We made a bet between the two of us...

330
00:43:25,781 --> 00:43:28,107
about how long it will take to be ruined.

331
00:43:28,201 --> 00:43:33,706
Don't take it personally, we're in a sporting spirit, right?

332
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:37,210
No, only one of us.

333
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,379
I will move a mountain.

334
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:25,010
When will it be finished?

335
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,353
Miss? For tomorrow.

336
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,600
There are days when he tells me tomorrow.

337
00:44:30,693 --> 00:44:32,484
I hope she's ready for the launch.

338
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:33,559
Tomorrow.

339
00:44:38,661 --> 00:44:41,781
I'd like to know what this guy really wants.

340
00:45:26,302 --> 00:45:27,500
What's its name?

341
00:45:27,595 --> 00:45:30,168
Paul Resenbrink. I am Dutch.

342
00:45:31,308 --> 00:45:33,431
But they call me Orinoco Paul...

343
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:37,180
Because I know every bend of that river by heart.

344
00:45:39,942 --> 00:45:42,269
Did you sail these rivers?

345
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:45,776
Yes. My last ship was the Adolfo.

346
00:45:45,908 --> 00:45:49,658
I can't see very well anymore, but that doesn't fool me.

347
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,326
What are you referring to?

348
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,127
The jungle can be very treacherous.

349
00:45:55,254 --> 00:45:58,623
It is full of lies, demons, and mirages.

350
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:04,389
I learned to distinguish between reality and hallucination.

351
00:46:06,684 --> 00:46:10,599
I see that you participated in the Pachitea expedition in '96.

352
00:46:10,814 --> 00:46:12,688
Yes, as a helmsman.

353
00:46:12,774 --> 00:46:15,148
On the return trip, I was the captain.

354
00:46:15,612 --> 00:46:19,941
The captain died; there were only five survivors.

355
00:46:23,286 --> 00:46:26,490
Paul Resenbrink is already the captain.

356
00:46:26,582 --> 00:46:28,659
Help me recruit the crew.

357
00:46:30,128 --> 00:46:32,703
We need tough and strong men.

358
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:36,424
I'm afraid we'll find few like that here.

359
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:38,588
First, a pilot.

360
00:46:41,267 --> 00:46:44,222
Is there anyone here with experience as a pilot?

361
00:46:44,312 --> 00:46:46,388
Hello, friends!

362
00:46:50,404 --> 00:46:51,434
End of the line!

363
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:54,733
Leave me alone, shorty! I am Huerequeque.

364
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:08,754
Buddy, I'm Huerequeque, the best cook in the Amazon.

365
00:47:08,883 --> 00:47:12,716
I've worked on all the ships here.

366
00:47:12,806 --> 00:47:14,299
And, my friend...

367
00:47:15,182 --> 00:47:18,137
I already know what they say about me.

368
00:47:18,895 --> 00:47:21,352
Huerequeque is nothing more than a drunkard...

369
00:47:22,984 --> 00:47:28,192
But this works perfectly.

370
00:47:30,994 --> 00:47:36,950
And besides, I'm the best marksman in all of Amazonas.

371
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:40,377
- What do you think of him? - Upstream and downstream.

372
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,204
- Is he really a good shot? - I've heard he is.

373
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:44,628
I'm going to hire him.

374
00:47:44,718 --> 00:47:47,554
- What's its name? Huere...? - Huerequeque!

375
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:54,266
Huerequeque is already our cook.

376
00:47:54,856 --> 00:47:56,600
Health!

377
00:48:03,282 --> 00:48:05,904
Please understand. Who bought the ship?

378
00:48:06,036 --> 00:48:09,868
Who paid for the ship? I have the right to go with you!

379
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:14,206
Molly, you can't leave the girls. What will they do without you?

380
00:48:14,587 --> 00:48:18,538
- And what will I do without you? - I will return.

381
00:48:20,595 --> 00:48:23,799
Fitz, do you still love me?

382
00:48:25,184 --> 00:48:27,260
We're partners, you and I.

383
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:28,460
Oh, Fitz, you crazy guy.

384
00:50:18,446 --> 00:50:22,361
Oh, Fitz, that's wonderful.

385
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,194
This is your day, Molly.

386
00:50:33,422 --> 00:50:35,914
He named him after me! It's more than my heart can bear!

387
00:50:36,009 --> 00:50:38,334
Darling, I love you.

388
00:50:39,304 --> 00:50:41,096
Now comes the official part.

389
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:43,597
Grab it. Throw it hard.

390
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,539
I will not allow these women to board.

391
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:16,174
They are my helpers. I can't cook without them.

392
00:52:04,449 --> 00:52:06,655
Aren't they going to Ucayali?

393
00:52:08,036 --> 00:52:12,284
Why go against the current? I thought I was going to Pongo das Mortes.

394
00:52:12,374 --> 00:52:13,833
You'll see soon enough.

395
00:52:13,918 --> 00:52:17,122
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald is traveling up the Amazon.

396
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:11,611
We are going upstream. Why?

397
00:53:12,406 --> 00:53:16,024
Because we're going... upstream.

398
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:20,248
And from now on, you will only leave the engine room when I tell you to.

399
00:54:33,753 --> 00:54:36,423
...very pretty dress, girl.

400
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:37,586
Leave him alone.

401
00:54:40,095 --> 00:54:42,550
Come outside. Let's go.

402
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:45,889
Come here. Take that off.

403
00:54:46,102 --> 00:54:52,188
Bastards, what are you doing here? Let go of my girls.

404
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:12,948
Dom Fitzcarraldo, Dom Fitzcarraldo!

405
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:14,700
He's back, sir, he's back.

406
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:18,625
I can't believe it, but it's here.

407
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:23,005
Look, the station is almost ready.

408
00:56:23,093 --> 00:56:24,671
I see you're already a father.

409
00:56:24,763 --> 00:56:28,596
Yes, yes. I knew you'd be back.

410
00:56:28,683 --> 00:56:30,972
I worked for six years without pay.

411
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,097
The station is now operational.

412
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:37,318
I paint the ticket booth every year, but it always gets dirty.

413
00:56:37,402 --> 00:56:41,401
I hope your trains cross the Amazon mountains...

414
00:56:41,449 --> 00:56:44,367
And then everything will change.

415
00:56:44,453 --> 00:56:48,665
Perhaps then you can pay me something, can't you, Dom Fitzcarraldo?

416
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:54,748
Look, the gears are turning...

417
00:56:54,841 --> 00:56:58,211
But I must confess something to you...

418
00:56:58,344 --> 00:57:03,766
I had to sell some iron parts and tools to the Indians.

419
00:57:03,851 --> 00:57:08,265
So that they could make machetes and other things.

420
00:57:08,356 --> 00:57:11,477
You already know, you can't get iron around here.

421
00:57:11,569 --> 00:57:17,075
They came at night to steal, so I had to sell.

422
00:57:17,117 --> 00:57:20,237
Otherwise, they would have killed me. They're worse than criminals.

423
00:57:21,247 --> 00:57:24,202
I'm alone here, what else could I do?

424
00:57:24,292 --> 00:57:27,827
I thought they fired him like everyone else.

425
00:57:30,258 --> 00:57:35,764
Let me show you something out there. Now, the tracks go 200m into the jungle.

426
00:57:39,811 --> 00:57:43,644
Come, I'll show you how I protect the tracks from the Indians.

427
00:57:43,732 --> 00:57:49,357
Beware of snakes.

428
00:57:50,782 --> 00:57:54,034
First I turn on the generator...

429
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:58,285
So I connect a long, very long cable to the rails.

430
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:02,540
When the Indians try to steal the railroad tracks, they burn their fingers.

431
00:58:02,631 --> 00:58:06,878
I kill snakes the same way; they turn to ashes.

432
00:58:08,638 --> 00:58:14,677
I clean the engine every year. When will the work resume?

433
00:58:15,981 --> 00:58:20,643
Well... the truth is we came for another project.

434
00:58:21,988 --> 00:58:25,903
Our financial situation will change completely if everything goes well.

435
00:58:27,785 --> 00:58:31,487
What I mean is that...

436
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:34,247
We need the train tracks for something else.

437
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:50,854
Not those tracks! Not the ones underneath the locomotive!

438
00:58:56,278 --> 00:59:00,147
Dom Fitzcarraldo! Dom Fitzcarraldo!

439
00:59:01,243 --> 00:59:03,817
Dom Fitzcarraldo, Dom Fitzcarraldo!

440
00:59:03,913 --> 00:59:07,614
They're taking the tracks from underneath the locomotive!

441
00:59:07,709 --> 00:59:10,378
Leave them so you can move the locomotive.

442
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,542
Stop them!

443
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,837
Leave those tracks alone, there's more in the jungle.

444
00:59:17,847 --> 00:59:21,096
- Thank you, thank you, thank you! - Okay, okay.

445
00:59:49,634 --> 00:59:52,589
We should have arrived in Pachitea a long time ago.

446
00:59:53,097 --> 00:59:55,137
Because we haven't arrived yet.

447
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:57,683
But according to the map...

448
00:59:58,145 --> 01:00:00,138
I don't trust maps.

449
01:00:01,732 --> 01:00:03,725
How can you be so sure?

450
01:00:17,251 --> 01:00:21,332
No river tastes like the Pachitea. It's right up ahead.

451
01:00:22,174 --> 01:00:23,752
Go...

452
01:01:43,439 --> 01:01:45,182
What's going on here?

453
01:01:45,524 --> 01:01:47,897
We are going up Pachitea.

454
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,239
He is sure?

455
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,350
Your mother!

456
01:02:26,573 --> 01:02:29,065
Where are we going? Damn it!

457
01:02:29,369 --> 01:02:32,205
Friends, welcome to Pachitea...

458
01:02:32,288 --> 01:02:35,658
known for the hospitality of its natives.

459
01:03:03,368 --> 01:03:05,610
Something is happening down there.

460
01:03:05,704 --> 01:03:08,706
They don't seem to agree with our direction.

461
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,580
What?

462
01:03:18,679 --> 01:03:19,959
A line of ignorant people.

463
01:03:20,055 --> 01:03:22,095
We are going to Pachitea.

464
01:03:22,141 --> 01:03:26,804
It's your fault, damn it...

465
01:03:36,325 --> 01:03:38,994
In Iquitos I said I needed men...

466
01:03:39,036 --> 01:03:41,528
Not cowards who shit in their underwear.

467
01:03:45,585 --> 01:03:46,749
Good...

468
01:03:48,507 --> 01:03:51,294
Whoever wants to go back, should take a step forward.

469
01:04:33,977 --> 01:04:36,766
Welcome to Saramiriza.

470
01:04:40,193 --> 01:04:42,519
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald.

471
01:04:42,556 --> 01:04:44,633
We believed it was an official mission.

472
01:04:46,033 --> 01:04:48,572
- Hello, Father. - Welcome.

473
01:04:49,871 --> 01:04:51,579
- Hello, Father. - Welcome.

474
01:04:52,207 --> 01:04:54,913
Welcome.

475
01:05:14,818 --> 01:05:16,941
Thank you, thank you.

476
01:05:19,741 --> 01:05:23,158
How can one learn patriotism from a school textbook?

477
01:05:23,245 --> 01:05:24,989
That's what the Government demands.

478
01:05:25,373 --> 01:05:29,039
Indigenous people have become accustomed to this, just as they have to vaccines.

479
01:05:29,378 --> 01:05:32,130
The boys already feel Peruvian.

480
01:05:32,214 --> 01:05:35,750
The other day I asked them: "Are they Indians?"

481
01:05:35,843 --> 01:05:37,587
"No," they replied.

482
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:40,253
"Those upstream, those are the real Indians."

483
01:05:40,349 --> 01:05:42,924
"And what about those who are indigenous?", I asked them.

484
01:05:43,227 --> 01:05:48,602
"Indians are people who don't know how to read or wash clothes."

485
01:05:49,193 --> 01:05:51,435
And what do the elders say?

486
01:05:51,571 --> 01:05:57,112
It seems we can't change their minds...

487
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:00,572
that our life is nothing more than an illusion...

488
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:03,750
Beyond that lies the reality of dreams.

489
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:08,629
I find these ideas very interesting.

490
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:11,376
I am an opera specialist.

491
01:06:13,556 --> 01:06:17,056
What do you know about the Jívaro people upriver?

492
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:20,098
I was at the 1996 disaster.

493
01:06:20,398 --> 01:06:23,185
Did they establish any contact after that?

494
01:06:23,401 --> 01:06:27,482
Yes, a few years ago two brothers left with the Indians.

495
01:06:27,573 --> 01:06:29,649
One of them returned shortly after...

496
01:06:29,742 --> 01:06:33,443
and said that the Jivaros had entered the jungle.

497
01:06:33,538 --> 01:06:36,326
The expedition disappeared without a trace.

498
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:38,374
A few weeks ago, one of our brothers

499
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:40,331
He went for a swim upstream... and found the body.

500
01:06:40,421 --> 01:06:44,255
They filled his stomach with stones and took his head.

501
01:06:45,677 --> 01:06:48,466
Tell me, what are you looking for upstream?

502
01:06:51,143 --> 01:06:53,385
I have a topographic survey project.

503
01:06:55,983 --> 01:06:57,560
Paul!

504
01:07:06,871 --> 01:07:11,249
Shut up, you damned drunks! That's enough!

505
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:38,529
Assert your authority, or you might as well look for another captain.

506
01:07:40,286 --> 01:07:41,614
What happened?

507
01:07:42,622 --> 01:07:45,908
Evaristo Chávez and Fabiano, the Brazilian.

508
01:07:46,001 --> 01:07:51,079
They and the ladies have to disembark immediately.

509
01:07:51,966 --> 01:07:55,668
E Huerequeque. He's clever but not trustworthy.

510
01:08:03,271 --> 01:08:05,347
They're fired.

511
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:08,443
You have two minutes to gather your belongings.

512
01:08:08,527 --> 01:08:12,229
You'll regret it...

513
01:08:14,785 --> 01:08:16,992
You, too.

514
01:08:17,705 --> 01:08:19,283
Come on, let's go.

515
01:08:22,294 --> 01:08:24,121
See the others.

516
01:08:24,505 --> 01:08:26,878
And the rest, to your posts.

517
01:08:27,551 --> 01:08:29,128
Let's get to work!

518
01:12:08,151 --> 01:12:11,317
Reduce speed, to half speed.

519
01:12:17,829 --> 01:12:19,822
What are the men doing?

520
01:12:29,802 --> 01:12:31,712
They armed themselves.

521
01:12:32,971 --> 01:12:35,464
They must not fire under any circumstances.

522
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,765
That was our mistake on the first expedition.

523
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:45,105
Go down and tell them this, if you don't want there to be a disaster.

524
01:13:11,769 --> 01:13:14,640
What the hell are you doing?

525
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:19,235
I'm just trying to communicate with our invisible friends.

526
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:22,357
Idiot! This could cost us our heads. First yours.

527
01:14:22,228 --> 01:14:25,598
There are silences and silences.

528
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:29,066
I don't like this one at all.

529
01:14:37,289 --> 01:14:39,780
There's something in the water.

530
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:43,707
Where?

531
01:14:44,422 --> 01:14:47,674
Something dark is floating towards us.

532
01:15:35,358 --> 01:15:37,731
What is an umbrella doing here?

533
01:15:37,861 --> 01:15:41,907
It must have belonged to one of the missionaries that the Jivaros killed.

534
01:15:46,788 --> 01:15:48,581
How strange...

535
01:15:52,337 --> 01:15:56,750
It sounds like a final warning from the naked butts.

536
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:59,467
They love flowery gestures.

537
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:19,948
Now it's Caruso's turn.

538
01:17:55,152 --> 01:17:57,691
Do you see the Indians in the canoe?

539
01:17:58,364 --> 01:18:00,524
Could it be a trap?

540
01:18:00,617 --> 01:18:02,859
It does not seem.

541
01:18:03,203 --> 01:18:05,611
No, I don't think so.

542
01:18:06,373 --> 01:18:09,625
They would attack at night...

543
01:18:09,712 --> 01:18:11,372
in larger groups.

544
01:18:15,051 --> 01:18:17,721
Shall we stop to make contact?

545
01:18:17,804 --> 01:18:20,094
No, we're not going to stop.

546
01:18:20,182 --> 01:18:22,259
They wouldn't talk to us either.

547
01:18:47,966 --> 01:18:49,966
Something is moving there.

548
01:18:52,471 --> 01:18:55,342
These indigenous people had never heard anything like it.

549
01:18:55,475 --> 01:18:57,303
This will teach them to respect us.

550
01:19:34,189 --> 01:19:37,059
Tell me everything you know about them.

551
01:19:42,365 --> 01:19:45,117
It all depends on how we act.

552
01:19:46,828 --> 01:19:51,824
The Jivaro people left the interior of Brazil 300 years ago.

553
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:55,413
For ten generations they wandered through the jungle...

554
01:19:55,505 --> 01:19:59,339
In search of a white god on a sacred ship.

555
01:19:59,468 --> 01:20:03,716
At the end of their pilgrimage, the god will guide them to a place where...

556
01:20:03,807 --> 01:20:08,137
There is neither pain nor death, a place where people never grow old.

557
01:20:09,397 --> 01:20:12,233
We will take advantage of this myth.

558
01:20:24,791 --> 01:20:26,915
What the hell does this have to do with us?

559
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:32,045
If a bald-ass comes near me, I'll put a bullet between his eyes.

560
01:20:32,258 --> 01:20:34,417
But this god doesn't arrive with cannons...

561
01:20:36,513 --> 01:20:39,005
...he arrives with Caruso's voice.

562
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:37,286
His loyal crew deserted.

563
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:39,912
This is the end of the journey.

564
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:54,096
Why didn't you go with them?

565
01:21:55,321 --> 01:21:57,407
Because I want to return on this damned ship.

566
01:21:59,831 --> 01:22:02,959
Don't cross my path. Now I'll do whatever I want here.

567
01:22:07,934 --> 01:22:09,498
Just keep the engine running.

568
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:26,066
Oh, those bastards!

569
01:22:29,616 --> 01:22:30,659
They attacked me by surprise.

570
01:22:32,461 --> 01:22:33,504
Those bastards!

571
01:22:36,804 --> 01:22:38,890
I already told you they were useless.

572
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,006
We'll never get out of here alive.

573
01:22:42,662 --> 01:22:44,748
It's just the three of us left. You, me, and Cholo.

574
01:22:44,770 --> 01:22:45,812
How, him?

575
01:22:45,813 --> 01:22:46,360
Renato Ximenes

576
01:22:48,723 --> 01:22:50,686
What do we need now?

577
01:22:50,687 --> 01:22:52,650
Is it desperately a good Italian opera?

578
01:24:43,312 --> 01:24:45,963
Well, gentlemen, this is the end. The dream is over.

579
01:24:51,955 --> 01:24:54,607
Can we rotate 180º?

580
01:24:58,119 --> 01:25:00,159
Try.

581
01:25:12,244 --> 01:25:13,880
Forget about it.

582
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,190
What did he say?

583
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:22,386
Turn around.

584
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:26,653
Do you see the same thing I do?

585
01:25:26,707 --> 01:25:28,812
That's all we needed.

586
01:25:29,595 --> 01:25:32,328
If we try to pass, it will be our end.

587
01:25:34,567 --> 01:25:37,188
There is only one way, to move forward.

588
01:25:39,687 --> 01:25:42,772
It's best that we get closer to the shore.

589
01:25:44,168 --> 01:25:46,384
Go to the engine room, but slowly.

590
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:56,684
They are armed with bows and arrows...

591
01:25:58,924 --> 01:26:00,695
But they keep their distance.

592
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:02,059
Had you seen anything like this before?

593
01:26:02,776 --> 01:26:04,174
No, never.

594
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:15,401
Damn them, now they're blocking our path.

595
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:53,591
Are they still there?

596
01:26:54,254 --> 01:26:58,498
Yes! Now there are even more, maybe a hundred canoes.

597
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:01,891
Let me know when the New Year begins.

598
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:05,498
I want to liven up my last hour with fireworks.

599
01:27:42,583 --> 01:27:46,031
Friends, you arrived just in time!

600
01:27:46,069 --> 01:27:49,188
This is where you drink a beer!

601
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:52,620
Come and have a drink! There's something for everyone!

602
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,491
- Where did you come from? - I was sleeping.

603
01:27:57,218 --> 01:27:59,309
Where are the others? Did they leave? I already suspected that.

604
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:03,504
They are cowards, degenerates! Wretches!

605
01:28:03,608 --> 01:28:04,689
Get out!

606
01:33:01,836 --> 01:33:03,066
What are they saying?

607
01:33:03,584 --> 01:33:05,042
They're talking about our ship...

608
01:33:06,065 --> 01:33:10,521
the sacred ship, with the white god from whom they await salvation.

609
01:33:11,383 --> 01:33:15,131
They believe there is a curse on this land.

610
01:33:17,114 --> 01:33:20,893
They know we're not gods, but the ship impressed them.

611
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:25,122
But why are they playing that flute? I don't know what they want.

612
01:33:37,537 --> 01:33:41,224
Friends, I think our journey isn't over yet.

613
01:34:39,638 --> 01:34:42,082
Do you see that reddish cliff beneath the trees?

614
01:34:42,697 --> 01:34:43,745
Try.

615
01:34:44,952 --> 01:34:46,533
It must be there.

616
01:34:46,922 --> 01:34:47,969
Good.

617
01:34:48,177 --> 01:34:51,713
However... We can't continue or we'll run aground on a sandbank.

618
01:34:53,733 --> 01:34:58,475
This slope may seem insignificant, but it will mark my destiny.

619
01:35:16,654 --> 01:35:18,507
Come on, follow me!

620
01:35:24,704 --> 01:35:26,868
Now he will show his cards.

621
01:35:52,168 --> 01:35:53,923
Here it is.

622
01:35:57,242 --> 01:35:59,563
This is exactly what we were looking for.

623
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:03,661
This? Here?

624
01:36:04,536 --> 01:36:09,717
Do we have to climb a tree for them to understand, you ignorant fools?

625
01:36:10,982 --> 01:36:15,767
We'll build a platform up there for you gentlemen.

626
01:36:39,889 --> 01:36:42,068
I can't believe this.

627
01:36:42,613 --> 01:36:44,730
Ali is or Ucayali.

628
01:36:45,961 --> 01:36:51,365
The entire river above Pongo das Mortes belongs to us.

629
01:36:51,394 --> 01:36:54,304
I know, I know. We'll build a tunnel for the railroad.

630
01:36:54,732 --> 01:36:56,516
No no.

631
01:36:56,862 --> 01:36:59,562
We will drag the ship over the mountain.

632
01:37:00,363 --> 01:37:02,571
And the Indians will help us.

633
01:37:03,546 --> 01:37:05,661
How the hell do you think I got it?

634
01:37:05,682 --> 01:37:08,033
Just like cows got to the moon.

635
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:10,723
I liked that.

636
01:37:13,841 --> 01:37:15,552
Count on me.

637
01:37:25,856 --> 01:37:27,110
Yes, come in.

638
01:37:32,686 --> 01:37:34,085
What it was?

639
01:37:34,121 --> 01:37:36,477
I still don't understand what you're proposing.

640
01:37:37,596 --> 01:37:39,716
Come in, I'll show you.

641
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:53,654
This is the Amazon.

642
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:59,286
Here is Iquitos.

643
01:38:00,522 --> 01:38:06,027
This is Ucayali... isn't it?

644
01:38:07,856 --> 01:38:09,403
And here...

645
01:38:10,015 --> 01:38:12,958
We have Pachitea.

646
01:38:13,671 --> 01:38:14,759
Good...

647
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:21,955
We went up the Amazon...

648
01:38:22,391 --> 01:38:25,058
and then Pachitea.

649
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:30,301
This is where we are now.

650
01:38:31,810 --> 01:38:35,370
And where will we drag the ship up this mountain?

651
01:38:37,908 --> 01:38:40,409
From here to here...

652
01:38:41,067 --> 01:38:46,753
The ship will collect rubber from thousands of workers.

653
01:38:48,152 --> 01:38:50,507
And why don't we go up the Ucayali?

654
01:38:51,376 --> 01:38:53,588
Because of the Pongo of Deaths.

655
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:56,436
No one has ever managed to cross those whirlpools.

656
01:38:56,541 --> 01:38:59,903
And how are you going to transport the rubber to Iquitos?

657
01:39:00,162 --> 01:39:02,319
We will need another ship.

658
01:39:02,572 --> 01:39:06,451
We will transport the rubber up the mountain, where we will build a storage facility.

659
01:39:06,597 --> 01:39:08,638
Well, soon we'll be so rich...

660
01:39:08,702 --> 01:39:13,377
We will have all the ships we need to take her to Iquitos.

661
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:18,702
I explained our project to him.

662
01:39:18,712 --> 01:39:21,090
- And what did he answer? - He said yes.

663
01:41:49,195 --> 01:41:51,305
a little further to the left...

664
01:41:52,008 --> 01:41:53,988
a little more...

665
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:55,052
Better!

666
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,909
a little further to our right...

667
01:42:00,882 --> 01:42:03,343
Okay... fine!

668
01:42:04,813 --> 01:42:06,066
Quiet!

669
01:42:06,553 --> 01:42:07,428
a little more...

670
01:42:07,809 --> 01:42:08,856
Alright, be quiet!

671
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:45,206
If it wasn't a pretty big mess...

672
01:42:47,716 --> 01:42:49,824
That wasn't a bad start, was it?

673
01:42:52,695 --> 01:42:56,654
They even left two children here. That's a good sign.

674
01:43:08,052 --> 01:43:12,052
What do you think? Will the indigenous people continue to help us?

675
01:43:12,949 --> 01:43:15,104
Nobody knows what they really think.

676
01:43:15,325 --> 01:43:18,711
But how on earth do you plan to get the ship up the mountain?

677
01:43:21,156 --> 01:43:24,811
And if nothing else works, we can build a tunnel.

678
01:43:25,951 --> 01:43:28,147
I could do it myself...

679
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:30,866
If it had a perfect pulley system.

680
01:43:33,031 --> 01:43:36,035
But I would need 16 km of rope...

681
01:43:36,138 --> 01:43:39,058
and it would take them 10 weeks to grow 25 cm.

682
01:43:39,178 --> 01:43:41,235
Unfortunately, we don't have that much time.

683
01:43:41,564 --> 01:43:44,029
We still have 7 months left before the option wins.

684
01:43:45,115 --> 01:43:48,079
We have a winch and the strength of hundreds of Indians.

685
01:43:49,495 --> 01:43:52,048
We will make the ship climb the mountain.

686
01:44:25,523 --> 01:44:26,959
Who are your little friends?

687
01:44:27,646 --> 01:44:28,871
McNamara.

688
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:33,486
McNamara is my assistant. And this is the commander.

689
01:44:34,674 --> 01:44:37,102
I drink to your health, McNamara.

690
01:44:47,373 --> 01:44:49,034
Ovitaro. Tovero mas...

691
01:44:49,597 --> 01:44:51,724
Tovero more, tovero more on him.

692
01:44:53,051 --> 01:44:55,201
Oh, overo, ovitaro, ovitaro, let me eat in peace...

693
01:44:57,422 --> 01:44:59,818
More and more, more and more, side by side, side by side...

694
01:45:31,069 --> 01:45:33,441
The difference in elevation is greater than I thought.

695
01:45:35,662 --> 01:45:37,634
Now that there are no more trees...

696
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:40,745
You can see how tilted it is.

697
01:45:42,145 --> 01:45:46,071
We'll have to level the ground, build a ramp...

698
01:45:47,239 --> 01:45:52,599
And up there, we'll have to make a good cut all the way to the top.

699
01:45:53,833 --> 01:45:55,676
This could take months.

700
01:45:56,216 --> 01:45:58,804
With dynamite! I hope we have enough.

701
01:45:59,425 --> 01:46:01,221
No! I wouldn't advise it...

702
01:46:02,395 --> 01:46:04,460
We have no other option.

703
01:47:03,776 --> 01:47:05,236
Take shelter!

704
01:47:05,966 --> 01:47:08,019
Warning! Dangerous! Dangerous!

705
01:47:14,076 --> 01:47:18,501
Wait! Wait! Where are you going?

706
01:47:19,051 --> 01:47:20,898
Get back to work, come on, come on.

707
01:47:22,107 --> 01:47:24,088
Get back to work.

708
01:49:52,009 --> 01:49:53,766
Huerequeque!

709
01:49:55,715 --> 01:49:57,647
We start here, come along.

710
01:50:01,048 --> 01:50:03,736
Give them a hand. Come on!

711
01:50:04,006 --> 01:50:06,956
How will this log withstand being pulled by hundreds of tons?

712
01:50:06,959 --> 01:50:08,153
He will endure.

713
01:50:09,225 --> 01:50:11,183
It is buried at a great depth.

714
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:13,915
This wood is as strong as iron.

715
01:50:15,635 --> 01:50:17,228
Bring it here.

716
01:50:37,884 --> 01:50:39,222
Come with me.

717
01:50:51,607 --> 01:50:53,985
Tell them to go to the other side.

718
01:50:58,887 --> 01:51:01,011
All of you, go there!

719
01:52:09,963 --> 01:52:11,159
Careful!

720
01:52:19,515 --> 01:52:20,581
Slowly!

721
01:53:03,759 --> 01:53:08,131
If I had known you were planning to take the ship up the rails...

722
01:53:08,685 --> 01:53:11,654
He would have told them to leave them at his station in the Amazon.

723
01:53:22,221 --> 01:53:23,967
I'm sorry I can't help you.

724
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:26,293
I drank too much last night.

725
01:53:50,474 --> 01:53:52,606
Shouldn't we say that the ice melts?

726
01:53:53,140 --> 01:53:55,448
In their language, the word "ice" does not exist.

727
01:54:41,146 --> 01:54:43,120
That's enough! Get out! Get out of here!

728
01:54:45,342 --> 01:54:47,209
In front!

729
01:55:41,919 --> 01:55:44,887
Try with all your might! More might!

730
01:55:50,932 --> 01:55:52,576
Try again!

731
01:56:01,804 --> 01:56:02,865
It's moving!

732
01:56:03,653 --> 01:56:05,865
It's moving! It's moving!

733
01:56:09,843 --> 01:56:11,535
Watch out! Watch out!

734
01:59:02,991 --> 01:59:06,232
They stayed like that for two days and two nights, watching the water.

735
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:09,717
It was certainly because of that horrible accident.

736
01:59:10,424 --> 01:59:12,507
I couldn't get a single word out of them.

737
01:59:35,231 --> 01:59:36,160
They're gone.

738
01:59:36,641 --> 01:59:38,733
Everyone? They're all gone?

739
01:59:40,979 --> 01:59:42,344
How do you know?

740
01:59:43,099 --> 01:59:45,253
I had a feeling and I went to check it out.

741
01:59:46,527 --> 01:59:50,227
Not a soul, nobody. They've all disappeared.

742
01:59:50,594 --> 01:59:52,359
This could mean many things.

743
01:59:52,664 --> 01:59:54,922
Perhaps they will attack us now, but we cannot defend ourselves.

744
01:59:56,521 --> 01:59:58,244
Everyone abandoned us.

745
01:59:58,425 --> 02:00:00,267
Except for my assistant McNamara.

746
02:00:00,990 --> 02:00:02,771
And that's why he'll be a boss someday.

747
02:00:56,267 --> 02:00:59,503
They all returned, as if they had never left.

748
02:01:04,211 --> 02:01:05,939
Don't ask me to explain.

749
02:01:27,664 --> 02:01:29,382
Two men died!

750
02:01:30,091 --> 02:01:31,623
I can't believe this crazy idea that

751
02:01:31,625 --> 02:01:33,155
Huerequeque had.

752
02:01:33,569 --> 02:01:35,376
Friends, the engine is running.

753
02:01:35,901 --> 02:01:38,048
That's what I call intellectual work.

754
02:01:38,376 --> 02:01:39,314
Two men died!

755
02:01:39,685 --> 02:01:43,564
We can remove the engine and attach the anchor to the winch.

756
02:01:43,859 --> 02:01:45,860
Thus the ship will rise by its own power.

757
02:01:46,650 --> 02:01:48,351
So, what do you say? Tell me?

758
02:03:38,733 --> 02:03:42,339
Sometimes the brain of an unfortunate peasant also works.

759
02:03:42,777 --> 02:03:45,033
You are not an unhappy peasant!

760
02:03:45,035 --> 02:03:47,290
He's the best drunk that ever lived on this Earth!

761
02:03:47,553 --> 02:03:49,509
- But we forgot something! - What?

762
02:03:49,961 --> 02:03:52,762
Caruso! Enrico Caruso!

763
02:05:42,395 --> 02:05:43,589
Why do they do all this?

764
02:05:45,639 --> 02:05:48,242
Why do they work like animals for us?

765
02:05:51,195 --> 02:05:51,938
Why?

766
02:05:53,951 --> 02:05:54,984
Why, why?

767
02:05:56,485 --> 02:05:57,331
Why?

768
02:06:00,213 --> 02:06:01,073
Why?

769
02:06:01,366 --> 02:06:04,098
I don't know either. I really don't know.

770
02:06:04,454 --> 02:06:07,362
But I assure you there will be a reason.

771
02:06:07,738 --> 02:06:10,939
I'm convinced they're planning something.

772
02:06:26,101 --> 02:06:27,064
You should drink.

773
02:06:28,065 --> 02:06:31,286
It's yucca with fermented saliva.

774
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:32,227
Come on, baby.

775
02:06:32,544 --> 02:06:36,404
My God, time flies, and we haven't accomplished anything.

776
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:17,779
They're plotting something.

777
02:09:18,029 --> 02:09:20,755
The Indians are preparing barbasco, a very potent poison...

778
02:09:21,071 --> 02:09:22,575
And, in addition, they paint themselves black.

779
02:09:23,088 --> 02:09:28,285
And most of them hid in the jungle and are armed.

780
02:09:43,537 --> 02:09:44,610
What does this mean?

781
02:09:44,932 --> 02:09:47,888
It means they believe they are invisible.

782
02:09:48,777 --> 02:09:52,333
They only do it when they go hunting or to war.

783
02:09:56,900 --> 02:09:59,451
Shouldn't we go back to the ship and load the rifles?

784
02:09:59,566 --> 02:10:01,628
No, we wouldn't have a chance.

785
02:10:19,730 --> 02:10:21,915
They're planning something...

786
02:10:23,149 --> 02:10:28,105
Perhaps they are calculating the exact size of our heads.

787
02:10:29,605 --> 02:10:31,108
For now, we are not in danger.

788
02:10:32,614 --> 02:10:33,773
How do you know?

789
02:10:35,685 --> 02:10:36,781
There is a clue.

790
02:10:38,290 --> 02:10:39,048
Look.

791
02:10:40,718 --> 02:10:42,653
Do you see those hands on the tracks?

792
02:20:40,134 --> 02:20:41,371
What happened?

793
02:20:41,476 --> 02:20:44,627
Pongo! Let's go to Pongo!

794
02:20:44,816 --> 02:20:46,051
Cholo!

795
02:21:00,472 --> 02:21:01,667
Cholo!

796
02:21:02,159 --> 02:21:03,972
Paul, Come on!

797
02:21:04,505 --> 02:21:06,927
I have to stop the ship.

798
02:21:14,750 --> 02:21:19,776
- Pongo! Let's go to Pongo! - Open the boiler, quick!

799
02:21:20,362 --> 02:21:22,319
Valves first!

800
02:21:50,904 --> 02:21:53,301
Oh my God! My ship!

801
02:22:11,710 --> 02:22:14,782
Damn it! It's too late now.

802
02:25:40,093 --> 02:25:41,632
Do you know what you're saying?

803
02:25:41,946 --> 02:25:44,737
He said that they released the moorings last night.

804
02:25:45,142 --> 02:25:48,102
They knew the sacred ship would ascend the mountain...

805
02:25:48,365 --> 02:25:50,381
so that it could pass freely through Pongo.

806
02:25:50,964 --> 02:25:55,470
They had to do it to appease the evil spirits of the whirlwinds.

807
02:25:56,054 --> 02:25:57,386
I have to stop my ship.

808
02:27:32,972 --> 02:27:35,526
First of all, take a sip.

809
02:27:36,606 --> 02:27:38,916
Crossing the Pongo River in a ship

810
02:27:38,917 --> 02:27:41,227
Steam power is something that will never happen again.

811
02:27:41,496 --> 02:27:43,047
That's quite an achievement.

812
02:27:43,604 --> 02:27:44,758
Grab your glass. Drink.

813
02:27:47,219 --> 02:27:50,434
Extraordinary, friends! Extraordinary!

814
02:27:51,499 --> 02:27:52,397
Take care. To your health!

815
02:27:52,877 --> 02:27:55,784
To appease the evil spirits of Pongo!

816
02:28:09,474 --> 02:28:10,719
I'll tell you a story.

817
02:28:12,708 --> 02:28:15,100
When North America had not yet been fully explored...

818
02:28:16,117 --> 02:28:19,332
A French pioneer headed west from Montreal...

819
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:25,008
He was the first white person to see Niagara Falls.

820
02:28:27,523 --> 02:28:30,023
When he returned, he said that he had seen

821
02:28:30,024 --> 02:28:32,523
the most immense and spectacular waterfalls...

822
02:28:32,854 --> 02:28:34,603
more than anyone could ever dream of.

823
02:28:37,078 --> 02:28:38,311
They didn't believe him.

824
02:28:39,206 --> 02:28:40,729
They thought he was crazy or a fraud.

825
02:28:43,468 --> 02:28:45,350
They asked him: "What proof do you have?"

826
02:28:48,478 --> 02:28:49,876
And he would answer:

827
02:28:52,254 --> 02:28:53,406
"My proof is..."

828
02:28:55,968 --> 02:28:57,338
that I saw them...

829
02:29:07,879 --> 02:29:11,718
I'm sorry, but I don't know what this has to do with me.

830
02:29:18,093 --> 02:29:20,095
What plans do you have? What do you intend to do now?

831
02:29:20,875 --> 02:29:21,872
I don't know.

832
02:29:23,534 --> 02:29:28,966
I'm asking because I'm interested in buying the ship again.

833
02:29:29,425 --> 02:29:32,166
My business has expanded lately.

834
02:29:32,423 --> 02:29:34,269
The damage could be repaired in a few days.

835
02:29:36,523 --> 02:29:43,552
I assure you that I do not intend to take advantage of your delicate situation.

836
02:29:43,589 --> 02:29:50,581
It comes from Manaus... I just found out that the European Opera Company...

837
02:29:50,811 --> 02:29:52,757
...will give a presentation.

838
02:29:53,130 --> 02:29:54,392
I think I should go.

839
02:29:55,355 --> 02:29:58,922
They say they're going to stage a sensational German composer...

840
02:30:00,300 --> 02:30:01,819
one of the most modern...

841
02:30:02,338 --> 02:30:06,107
Federico, Roberto, Ricardo...

842
02:30:06,746 --> 02:30:07,771
What's your name? Ricardo...

843
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:10,207
Wagner! He's the author of "Parsifal".

844
02:30:11,590 --> 02:30:15,232
Yes, yes, it must be that one. A very Teutonic song.

845
02:30:15,624 --> 02:30:18,227
And the opera is called "The Puritans".

846
02:30:18,652 --> 02:30:21,100
No, that's an Italian opera by Bellini.

847
02:30:27,817 --> 02:30:28,851
Listen...

848
02:30:31,739 --> 02:30:33,292
Was he serious about the ship?

849
02:30:35,789 --> 02:30:36,985
Hey, Cholo! They needed it!

850
02:30:37,001 --> 02:30:37,893
Come closer.

851
02:30:39,026 --> 02:30:40,273
- Paul! - Yes?

852
02:30:48,444 --> 02:30:51,028
Friends, the new owner of Molly Aida.

853
02:30:51,412 --> 02:30:53,300
But we can still use the ship for two weeks.

854
02:30:53,601 --> 02:30:57,746
Paul, listen. I hate having to give you up.

855
02:30:58,687 --> 02:31:00,437
Go to Manaus with this money...

856
02:31:02,848 --> 02:31:07,388
And buy me a tailcoat and the finest cigars in the world.

857
02:31:07,516 --> 02:31:11,260
And from the theater I want an armchair upholstered in red velvet.

858
02:31:11,688 --> 02:31:15,023
I promised a pig that adores Caruso.

859
02:31:18,757 --> 02:31:20,080
And then...

860
02:32:26,967 --> 02:32:28,056
Professor...

861
02:32:39,095 --> 02:32:42,446
My armchair, my armchair.
