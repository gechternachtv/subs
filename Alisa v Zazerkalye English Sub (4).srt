1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,896
Through the Looking Glass

2
00:00:12,104 --> 00:00:14,423
after eponymous tale by L. Carroll

3
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:16,496
Part Four

4
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:24,177
While Alice, the King and the Messenger
were running to see fight between the
Unicorn and the Lion,

5
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,221
Alice remembered the words of an old song:

6
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:40,695
The Lion and the Unicorn
were fighting for the crown:
The Lion beat the Unicorn
all round the town

7
00:00:41,177 --> 00:00:50,929
Some gave them white bread,
some gave them brown:
Some gave them plum-cake
and drummed them out of town.

8
00:00:53,864 --> 00:01:00,496
- Does the one that wins get the crown?
- Dear me, no! What an idea!

9
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:09,857
- Would you be good enough to stop a minute?
- Stop a minute? First you'd have to catch it,

10
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:12,680
and I'm not strong enough;
it goes by so fearfully quick.

11
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:18,280
Breeeaaaak! Ten minutes!

12
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:26,351
- What—is—this?
- This is a child. A living child.

13
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:31,149
I always thought they were fabulous monsters!

14
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:35,491
Do you know, I always thought Unicorns
were fabulous monsters, too!

15
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:40,091
Well, if you'll believe in me, I'll
believe in you. Is that a bargain?

16
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:41,599
Yes, if you like.

17
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:46,347
Then hand round the plum-cake, Monster!

18
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:58,617
I don't understand! I've cut several slices
already, but they always join on again!

19
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:06,297
You don't know how to manage Looking-glass
cakes. Hand it round first, and cut it afterwards.

20
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,210
Lion's piece

21
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:22,343
Alice couldn't make out where
the drumming came from.

22
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:27,607
"Now they will be drummed out of town,"
thought Alice, "the sooner the better!"

23
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:37,404
Ahoy! Ahoy! Check! You're my prisoner!

24
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:41,083
Ahoy! Ahoy! Check!

25
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:48,924
- She's <i>my</i> prisoner, you know!
- But then <i>I</i> came and rescued her!

26
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,982
It was a glorious victory, wasn't it?

27
00:02:55,414 --> 00:03:02,109
I don't know. I don't want to be
anybody's prisoner. I want to be a Queen!

28
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,382
So you will, when you've crossed
the next brook. I'll accompany you.

29
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:15,573
I was wondering what the mouse-trap was for.
It's hard to imagine mice living on horses.

30
00:03:16,118 --> 00:03:21,126
Hard, yet possible. I wouldn't like
them running all about me.

31
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:28,450
- I'm afraid you've not had much
practice in riding, yes?

32
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:34,959
- I've had plenty of practice.
The great art of riding is...

33
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:38,776
is to keep one's balance!

34
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:45,529
My mind goes on working all the same.
the more head downwards I am,
the deeper are my thoughts.

35
00:03:48,246 --> 00:03:52,646
Are you sad? Let me sing you a song.
When I sing it, everyone either cries or...

36
00:03:52,977 --> 00:03:55,385
- Or what?
- Or doesn't cry!

37
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:02,280
So many creatures live in my wood!
Hare and elk and badger.

38
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:08,515
An old wood grouse, hearing a fox,
Flies onto a thick branch.

39
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:15,732
A hedgehog I have, who hurried along
To dine with his good friends.

40
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:22,604
Yet there is no elephant here in my wood,
There's no merry elephant here...

41
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:34,981
A hedgehog embroiders my shirt with a cross
And sings me a song in deep bass.

42
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:41,075
A dear fox scatters my yard with sand
And sweeps my room with her tail.

43
00:04:41,652 --> 00:04:48,164
A titmouse flies over my head as it tweets,
A gopher's my neighbor and friend.

44
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:54,847
Yet there is no elephant here in my wood,
There's no merry elephant here...

45
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:05,516
Look, there's your finish line.
Now I will leave you, my child.

46
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:11,729
Won't you wave your handkerchief to me?
It may keep me from losing heart.

47
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:16,906
Years afterwards, Alice could bring
the whole scene back again, as if it
had been only yesterday -

48
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:25,213
the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of
the Knight, the setting sun gleaming
through his hair,

49
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:28,621
and the black shadows of the forest behind.

50
00:05:39,897 --> 00:05:47,033
Ah, I never expected I should be a Queen so soon!

51
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:56,770
Please, would you tell me...
- Speak when you're spoken to!

52
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:56,727
You can't be a Queen, till you've
passed the examination!

53
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:03,233
Here is an exercise in Division: Divide
a loaf by a knife — what's the answer?

54
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:10,153
- I suppose.....
- Bread-and-butter, of course!
No try Subtraction:

55
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:14,769
Take a bone from a dog: what remains?
- Nothing would remain.

56
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:19,474
Wrong! The dog's temper would remain!
- How's that?

57
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:25,146
- Tell me, what's the cause of lightning?
- The thunder! No, no, no! The other way.

58
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:32,159
Oh, we had <i>such</i> a thunderstorm
last Friday!

59
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:36,850
I mean one of the last set of Fridays!

60
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,800
In <i>our</i> country,
there's only one Friday at a time.

61
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,630
Hee-hee, that's a poor thin way
of doing things!

62
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:46,713
Now <i>here</i>, we sometimes
take as many as five Fridays a week!

63
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:52,266
By the way, I invite you to Alice's
dinner-party this afternoon.

64
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:57,525
- And I invite <i>you</i>.
- I didn't know I was to have a party at all.

65
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:02,502
But if there is to be one, I think
<i>I</i> ought to invite the guests.

66
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:06,079
We gave you the opportunity of doing it,

67
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:09,314
but I daresay you've not had
many lessons in manners yet.

68
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:22,260
Reception is postponed till the week after next!

69
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:31,395
To the Looking-Glass world
it was Alice that said,
"I've a sceptre in hand,
I've a crown on my head;

70
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:39,584
Let the Looking-Glass creatures,
whatever they be,
Come and dine with the Red Queen,
the White Queen, and me."

71
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:48,780
Let me introduce you:
Alice—Mutton; Mutton—Alice.

72
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:52,678
- May I give you a slice?
- Certainly not!

73
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:56,277
It isn't etiquette to cut any one
you've been introduced to.

74
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:59,014
Remove the joint!

75
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,655
I won't be introduced to the pudding,
please! Or we shall get no dinner at all!

76
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:08,444
Pudding—Alice; Alice—Pudding.
Remove the pudding!

77
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:14,309
To queen Alice's health!

78
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:31,972
Here I am!

79
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:39,457
Enough! Enough, I said! Stop this at once!

80
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:44,720
As for <i>you</i>, I'll shake you
into a kitten!

81
00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:51,722
"I had such a wonderful dream,
but Kitty woke me," thought Alice.

82
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,560
And she was with me in the Looking-Glass world.

83
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:59,071
But of course! The Black Queen was Kitty!

84
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:03,596
But Kitty only purred in reply, and
pretended it hadn't heard Alice.

85
00:09:03,941 --> 00:09:07,237
It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens

86
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:13,701
that, whatever you say to them,
they <i>always</i> purr.

87
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:24,732
I hear you saying: "like fairy-tale living"
But judge for yourselves: is that easily lived?

88
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:35,388
You can't do a thing here without being cautious,
Because of uncertainly and of obscurity,
And lack of knowledge and unpleasantness...

89
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:42,136
Oh, it's so complicated!
And that's where the fun is!
You can't take one step here without taking care.

90
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,831
I raced through the story
on a path of danger,

91
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,705
I wanted to quickly
Reach the denouement.

92
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:57,848
Now, the denouement's here,
And I'm a bit sorry

93
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:03,842
Recalling my story
As I'm growing up.
