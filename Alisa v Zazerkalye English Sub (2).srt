1
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:11,456
Through the Looking Glass

2
00:00:14,337 --> 00:00:17,497
after the eponymous tale by L. Carroll

3
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:20,129
Part Two

4
00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:29,646
And so, on the garden path walking towards
Alice was the Black Queen herself.

5
00:00:32,614 --> 00:00:34,438
I think I'll go and meet her!

6
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:51,359
I think I'll go not towards her
but away from her.
Maybe then I'll manage to meet her.

7
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:06,031
Where do you come from? And where are
you going? Look up, speak nicely, and
don't twiddle your fingers all the time.

8
00:01:06,798 --> 00:01:13,805
It's time for you to answer now, and
don't forget to say "your Majesty".

9
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:21,005
I only... wanted to... see what the
garden was like, your Majesty.

10
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:31,238
Is this a garden? I've seen such gardens
compared with which this would be a wilderness.

11
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:34,861
And I thought I'd try and find my way
to the top of that hill.

12
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:44,438
Is this a hill? I've seen such hills
compared with which this would be a valley.

13
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:48,935
But... no! A hill <i>can't</i> be a
valley, you know. That would be nonsense!

14
00:01:49,669 --> 00:02:01,158
Is it nonsense?! I've heard nonsense,
compared with which that would be
as sensible as a dictionary!

15
00:02:05,798 --> 00:02:14,094
I declare it's marked out just like a
large chessboard! And there are the chess
pieces! Oh!... Oh-oh-oh, how interesting!

16
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:30,126
How I wish... that I might join... this game.
I wouldn't mind being a Pawn, though of course
I should <i>like</i> to be a Queen, best.

17
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:41,063
That's easily managed. You can be the
White Queen's Pawn, and you're in the
Second Square to begin with: when you
get to the Eighth Square you'll be a Queen.

18
00:02:41,606 --> 00:02:49,862
A pawn goes two squares in its first move,
you know. So you'll go very quickly through
the Third Square—by railway, I should think.

19
00:02:50,965 --> 00:02:53,998
In the Fourth Square you'll meet
Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

20
00:02:54,694 --> 00:02:57,286
The Fifth is mostly water.

21
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,871
The Sixth belongs to Humpty Dumpty.

22
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:07,415
But you make no remark?
- I—I didn't know I had to make one.

23
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:12,278
You <i>should</i> have said, "It's
extremely kind of you to tell me all this".

24
00:03:13,597 --> 00:03:22,437
However, we'll suppose it said. The
Seventh Square is all forest — however,
a Knight on a horse will show you the way.

25
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:35,229
And in the Eighth Square we shall be Queens
together, and it's all feasting and fun!

26
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:38,966
Faster! Faster!

27
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:47,309
- Is it still far?
- We passed 'still' a minute ago. Faster!

28
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:55,021
- You may rest a little now.
- Why, I do believe we've been
under this tree the whole time!

29
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:58,342
But of course, what did you expect?

30
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:02,118
Well, in <i>our</i> country, if you ran
very fast for a long time you'd
generally get to somewhere else.

31
00:04:04,637 --> 00:04:12,100
A slow sort of country! Now, <i>here</i>,
you see, it takes all the running <i>you</i>
can do, to keep in the same place.

32
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:17,142
If you want to get somewhere else,
you must run at least twice as fast as that!
Let's run!

33
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:22,823
I'm quite content to stay here —
only I <i>am</i> so hot and thirsty!

34
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:28,574
That can easily be helped.
Have a biscuit?

35
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:39,294
Alice thought it would not be civil to
say "No", although the biscuit was <i>very</i>
dry, and she almost choked.

36
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,166
While you're refreshing yourself, I shall
go. Keep your head up, turn out your toes
as you walk — and remember who you are!

37
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:48,702
Good-bye!

38
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:57,551
Oh, what's that down there?
Just like a swarm of bees!

39
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:05,671
Of course, they were not bees.
In fact, these were elephants,
as Alice very soon confirmed.

40
00:05:06,102 --> 00:05:09,031
Though the idea quite took her
breath away at first.

41
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:25,006
What fun! When they ask me at home how
well I liked my walk, I shall say — "Oh,
I liked it well enough — only it was so dusty
and hot, and the elephants did tease so!"

42
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:29,909
Then Alice remembered that she was
a Pawn and had to make a move.

43
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:49,724
Tickets, please!
And where's your ticket, child?

44
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:58,787
Don't keep him waiting, child!
Do you know how much his time is worth?
Why, a thousand pounds a minute!

45
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:05,644
I'm afraid I haven't got one. There
wasn't a ticket-office where I got on.

46
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:15,355
There wasn't room for one. Do you
know how much the land there is worth?
Why, a thousand pounds an inch!

47
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,244
You should have bought one
from the engine-driver.

48
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:29,925
The man that drives the engine. Do you
know how much train's smoke alone is worth?
Why, a thousand pounds a puff!

49
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:32,814
Then there's no use in speaking.

50
00:06:34,518 --> 00:06:37,854
And, to Alice's great surprise,
everybody <i>thought</i> in chorus:

51
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:44,509
Better say nothing at all. Do you
know how much language is worth?
A thousand pounds a word!

52
00:06:45,557 --> 00:06:52,206
I hope you understand what <i>thinking in
chorus</i> means — for I must confess that <i>I</i> don't.

53
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,758
You're travelling the wrong way.

54
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:41,622
Oh, what funny river-horse-flies!
How interesting, where are they flying to?

55
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:47,659
And that is, probably, a baobab-fly...

56
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,044
But then Alice remembered she
was already on the Fourth Line,
and it was time to move on.

57
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:04,221
To the House of Tweedledum
To the House of Tweedledee

58
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:10,924
I hear you saying: "like fairy-tale living"
But judge for yourselves: is that easily lived?

59
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:21,667
You can't do a thing here without being cautious,
Because of uncertainly and of obscurity,
And lack of knowledge and unpleasantness...

60
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:28,429
Oh, it's so complicated!
And that's where the fun is!
You can't take one step here without taking care.

61
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:33,843
How funny and strange are
the rules in this story -

62
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:38,731
Here everything's different,
It's all somewhat "off".

63
00:08:39,547 --> 00:08:43,723
Wherever you look here,
You find only riddles!

64
00:08:45,756 --> 00:08:47,809
Wherever you look, yes,
wherever you look here,
You'll find a big mess.
